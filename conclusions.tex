\section{Contributions}
\label{se:contributions}

The main contribution of this thesis is the realisation of the fundamental aspects of a higher-dimensional Geographic Information System.
By approaching this problem in a practical manner, many of the technical issues of its development were investigated, including an analysis of its possible internal (in-memory) and external (exchange format) representations, the development of basic algorithms for object construction and visualisation, and the development of GIS data repair tools for 2D and 3D datasets.
