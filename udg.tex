\chapter{UDG}

Low Surface Brightness (LSB) galaxies are defined as having \citep{Venhola2017}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
 \mu_{0,r'} > 23 \mbox{ mag/arcsec}^2\\

 M_{r'} > -19
\end{cases}
\end{equation}



\subsection{Magnitude conversion}
\pynbody{} can be programmed to compute luminosities of stellar particles using 
The built in libraries are from Marico... Padova... %TODO
To obtain SDSS bands we ued converison formulas from here, after having computed the magnitudes in Johnson bands.

In particular:
