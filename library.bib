abstract = {Observationally, the quenching of star-forming galaxies appears to depend both on their mass and environment. The exact cause of the environmental dependence is still poorly understood, yet semi-analytic models (SAMs) of galaxy formation need to parameterise it to reproduce observations of galaxy properties. In this work, we use hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the quenching of disk galaxies through ram-pressure stripping (RPS) as they fall into galaxy clusters with the goal of characterising the importance of this effect for the reddening of disk galaxies. Our set-up employs a live model of a galaxy cluster that interacts with infalling disk galaxies on different orbits. We use the moving-mesh code AREPO, augmented with a special refinement strategy to yield high resolution around the galaxy on its way through the cluster in a computationally efficient way. Our direct simulations differ substantially from stripping models employed in current SAMs, which in most cases overpredict the mass loss from RPS. Furthermore, after pericentre passage, as soon as ram pressure becomes weaker, gas that remains bound to the galaxy is redistributed to the outer parts, an effect that is not captured in simplified treatements of RPS. Star formation in our model galaxies is quenched mainly because the hot gas halo is stripped, depriving the galaxy of its gas supply. The cold gas disk is only stripped completely in extreme cases, leading to full quenching and significant reddening on timescale of {\~{}}200 Myr. On the other hand, galaxies experiencing only mild ram pressure actually show an enhanced star formation rate that is consistent with observations and are quenched on timescales {\textgreater} 1 Gyr. Stripped gas in the wake is mixed efficiently with intracluster gas already a few tens of kpc behind the disk, and this gas is free of residual star formation.},

@article{Schroyen2011,
abstract = {We show results based on a large suite of N-Body/SPH simulations of isolated, flat dwarf galaxies, both rotating and non-rotating. The main goal is to investigate possible mechanisms to explain the observed dichotomy in radial stellar metallicity profiles of dwarf galaxies: dwarf irregulars (dIrr) and flat, rotating dwarf ellipticals (dE) generally possess flat metallicity profiles, while rounder and non-rotating dEs show strong negative metallicity gradients. These simulations show that flattening by rotation is key to reproducing the observed characteristics of flat dwarf galaxies, proving particularly efficient in erasing metallicity gradients. We propose a "centrifugal barrier mechanism" as an alternative to the previously suggested "fountain mechanism" for explaining the flat metallicity profiles of dIrrs and flat, rotating dEs. While only flattening the dark-matter halo has little influence, the addition of angular momentum slows down the infall of gas, so that star formation (SF) and the ensuing feedback are less centrally concentrated, occurring galaxy-wide. Additionally, this leads to more continuous SFHs by preventing large-scale oscillations in the SFR ("breathing"), and creates low density holes in the ISM, in agreement with observations of dIrrs. Our general conclusion is that rotation has a significant influence on the evolution and appearance of dwarf galaxies, and we suggest angular momentum as a second parameter (after galaxy mass as the dominant parameter) in dwarf galaxy evolution. Angular momentum differentiates between SF modes, making our fast rotating models qualitatively resemble dIrrs, which does not seem possible without rotation.},

abstract = {Star formation lies at the center of a web of processes that drive cosmic evolution: generation of radiant energy, synthesis of elements, formation of planets, and development of life. Decades of observations have yielded a variety of empirical rules about how it operates, but at present we have no comprehensive, quantitative theory. In this review I discuss the current state of the field of star formation, focusing on three central questions: what controls the rate at which gas in a galaxy converts to stars? What determines how those stars are clustered, and what fraction of the stellar population ends up in gravitationally-bound structures? What determines the stellar initial mass function, and does it vary with star-forming environment? I use these three question as a lens to introduce the basics of star formation, beginning with a review of the observational phenomenology and the basic physical processes. I then review the status of current theories that attempt to solve each of the three problems, pointing out links between them and opportunities for theoretical and numerical work that crosses the scale between them. I conclude with a discussion of prospects for theoretical progress in the coming years.},

abstract = {The Local Group (LG) dwarf galaxies offer a unique window to the detailed properties of the most common type of galaxy in the Universe. In this review, I update the census of LG dwarfs based on the most recent distance and radial velocity determinations. I then discuss the detailed properties of this sample, including (a) the integrated photometric parameters and optical structures of these galaxies, (b) the content, nature and distribution of their ISM, (c) their heavy-element abundances derived from both stars and nebulae, (d) the complex and varied star-formation histories of these dwarfs, (e) their internal kinematics, stressing the relevance of these galaxies to the dark-matter problem and to alternative interpretations, and (f) evidence for past, ongoing and future interactions of these dwarfs with other galaxies in the Local Group and beyond. To complement the discussion and to serve as a foundation for future work, I present an extensive set of basic observational data in tables that summarize much of what we know, and what we still do not know, about these nearby dwarfs. Our understanding of these galaxies has grown impressively in the past decade, but fundamental puzzles remain that will keep the Local Group at the forefront of galaxy evolution studies for some time.},

abstract = {We investigate the evolution of dwarf galaxies using N -body/SPH simulations that incorporate their formation histories through merger trees constructed using the ex- tended Press-Schechter formalism. The simulations are computationally cheap and have high spatial resolution. We compare the properties of galaxies with equal final mass but with different merger histories with each other and with those of observed dwarf spheroidals and irregulars. We show that the merger history influences many observable dwarf galaxy proper- ties. We identify two extreme cases that make this influence stand out most clearly: (i) merger trees with one massive progenitor that grows through relatively few mergers and (ii) merger trees with many small progenitors that merge only quite late. At a fixed halo mass, a type (i) tree tends to produce galaxies with larger stellar masses, larger half-light radii, lower central surface brightness, and since fewer potentially an- gular momentum cancelling mergers are required to build up the final galaxy, a higher specific angular momentum, compared with a type (ii) tree. We do not perform full-fledged cosmological simulations and therefore cannot hope to reproduce all observed properties of dwarf galaxies. However, we show that the simulated dwarfs are not unsimilar to real ones.},

abstract = {The Hubble constant, H0, or its dimensionless equivalent, "little h", is a fundamental cosmological property that is now known to an accuracy better than a few percent. Despite its cosmological nature, little h commonly appears in the measured properties of individual galaxies. This can pose unique challenges for users of such data, particularly with survey data. In this paper we show how little h arises in the measurement of galaxies, how to compare like-properties from different datasets that have assumed different little h cosmologies, and how to fairly compare theoretical data with observed data, where little h can manifest in vastly different ways. This last point is particularly important when observations are used to calibrate galaxy formation models, as calibrating with the wrong (or no) little h can lead to disastrous results when the model is later converted to the correct h cosmology. We argue that in this modern age little h is an anachronism, being one of least uncertain parameters in astrophysics, and we propose that observers and theorists instead treat this uncertainty like any other. We conclude with a "cheat sheet" of nine points that should be followed when dealing with little h in data analysis.},

The data reveal a star-less HI tail that contains {\~{}}10{\%} of the atomic gas of NGC 1427A as well as extended stellar emission that shed new light on the recent history of this galaxy. Rather than being the result of ram pressure induced star-formation, as previously suggested in the literature, the disturbed optical appearance of NGC 1427A has tidal origins. The galaxy itself likely consists of two individual objects in an advanced stage of merging. The HI tail may be made of gas expelled to large radii during the same tidal interaction. It is possible that some of this gas is subject to ram pressure, which would be considered a secondary effect and imply a northwest trajectory of NGC 1427A within the Fornax cluster.},

@article{Vandenbroucke2013c,
abstract = {Simulation codes for galaxy formation and evolution take on board as many physical processes as possible beyond the standard gravitational and hydrodynamical physics. Most of this extra physics takes place below the resolution level of the simulations and is added in a " sub-grid " fashion. However, these sub-grid processes affect the macroscopic hydrodynamical properties of the gas and thus couple to the " on-grid " physics that is explicitly integrated during the simulation. In this paper, we focus on the link between partial ionization and the hydrodynamical equa-tions. We show that the energy stored in ions and free electrons constitutes a potential energy term which breaks the linear dependence of the internal energy on temperature. Correctly tak-ing into account ionization hence requires modifying both the equation of state and the energy-temperature relation. We implemented these changes in the cosmological simulation code Gad-get2. As an example of the effects of these changes, we study the propagation of Sedov-Taylor shock waves through an ionizing medium. This serves as a proxy for the absorption of supernova feedback energy by the interstellar medium. Depending on the density and temperature of the surrounding gas, we find that up to 50{\%} of the feedback energy is spent ionizing the gas rather than heating it. Thus, it can be expected that properly taking into account ionization effects in galaxy evolution simulations will drastically reduce the effects of thermal feedback. To the best of our knowledge, this potential energy term is not used in current simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.},

abstract = {By means of post-processed cosmological Hydrodynamics simulations we explore the ability of the fossil record method to recover the stellar mass, age gradients, and global/radial star formation and mass growth histories of galaxies observed with an optical Integral Field Unity. We use two simulations of representative Milky Way-sized galaxies, one disk dominated and another bulge-dominated. We generate data cubes emulating MaNGA/SDSS-IV instrumental and observational conditions, and analyze them using the Pipe3D pipeline. For optimal MaNGA instrumental/observational setups, the global masses, ages, and dust extinctions of both galaxies are well recovered within the uncertainties, while for the radial distributions, the trend is to get slightly flatter age gradients and weaker inside-out growth modes than the true ones. The main bias is in recovering younger stellar populations in the inner, older regions, and slightly older stellar populations in the outer, younger regions, as well as lower global stellar masses. These trends are enhanced as lower is the spatial sampling/resolution (less number of fibers), more inclined and dust-attenuated is the observed galaxy, lower is the signal-to-noise ratio, and worse is the seeing. The recovered properties and histories are more affected for the disk-dominated galaxy with a prominent inside-out growth mode than for the bulge-dominated galaxy assembled earlier and more coherently. We make publicly available the code and the mock IFU datacubes used in this paper.},

abstract = {We present the analysis of a deep (167 ks) ROSAT HRI observation of the cD galaxy NGC 1399 in the Fornax cluster. Using both HRI and, at larger radii, archival PSPC data, we find that the radial behavior of the X-ray surface brightness profile is not consistent with a simple Beta model and suggests instead three distinct components. We use a multi-component bidimensional model to study in detail these three components that we identify respectively with the cooling flow region, the galactic and the cluster halo. From these data we derive a binding mass distribution in agreement with that suggested by optical dynamical indicators, with an inner core dominated by luminous matter and an extended dark halo differently distributed on galactic and cluster scales. The HRI data and a preliminary analysis of Chandra public data, allow us to detect significant density fluctuations in the halo. We discuss possible non-equilibrium scenarios to explain the hot halo structure, including tidal interactions with neighboring galaxies, ram stripping from the intra-cluster medium and merging events. In the innermost region of NGC 1399, the comparison between the X-ray and radio emission suggests that the radio emitting plasma is displacing and producing shocks in the hot X-ray emitting gas. We found that the NGC 1404 halo is well represented by a single symmetric Beta model and follows the stellar light profile within the inner 8 kpc. The mass distribution is similar to the `central' component of the NGC 1399 halo. At larger radii ram pressure stripping from the intra-cluster medium produces strong asymmetries in the gas distribution. Finally we discuss the properties of the point source population finding evidence of correlation between the source excess and NGC 1399.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new calculation of composition-dependent radiative cooling and heating curves of low-density gas, intended primarily for use in numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution. These curves depend on only five parameters: temperature, density, redshift, [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe]. They are easily tabulated and can be efficiently interpolated during a simulation. The ionization equilibrium of 14 key elements is determined for temperatures between 10 K and 109 K and densities up to 100 amu cm-3 taking into account collisional and radiative ionization, by the cosmic UV background and an interstellar radiation field, and by charge-transfer reactions. These elements, ranging from H to Ni, are the ones most abundantly produced and/or released by SNIa, SNII and intermediate-mass stars. Self-shielding of the gas at high densities by neutral hydrogen is taken into account in an approximate way by exponentially suppressing the H-ionizing part of the cosmic UV background for H I densities above a threshold density of nHI, crit = 0.007 cm-3. We discuss how the ionization equilibrium, and the cooling and heating curves, depends on the physical properties of the gas. The main advantage of the work presented here is that, within the confines of a well-defined chemical evolution model and adopting the ionization equilibrium approximation, it provides accurate cooling and heating curves for a wide range of physical and chemical gas properties, including the effects of self-shielding. The latter is key to resolving the formation of cold, neutral, high-density clouds suitable for star formation in galaxy simulations.},

As a first application, we apply our method to the ‘ultra-faint' dwarf Eridanus II (Eri II) that has a lone star cluster ∼45 pc from its centre. Using a grid of collisional N-body simulations, incorporating the effects of stellar evolution, external tides and dynamical friction, we show that a DM core for Eri II naturally reproduces the size and the projected position of its star cluster. By contrast, a dense cusped galaxy requires the cluster to lie implausibly far from the centre of Eri II ({\textgreater}1 kpc), with a high inclination orbit that must be observed at a particular orbital phase. Our results, therefore, favour a DM core. This implies that either a cold DM cusp was ‘heated up' at the centre of Eri II by bursty star formation or we are seeing an evidence for physics beyond cold DM.},

abstract = {Recent discoveries of massive black holes (MBHs) in dwarf galaxies suggest that they may have a more common presence than once thought. Systematic searches are revealing more candidates, but this process could be accelerated by predictions from simulations. We perform a study of several high-resolution, cosmological, zoom-in simulations focusing on dwarf galaxies that host massive black holes at z = 0, with the aim of determining when the black holes are most observable. Larger dwarf galaxies are more likely to host MBHs than those of lower mass. About 50{\%} of the MBHs in dwarfs are not centrally located, but rather are wandering within a few kpc of the galaxy center. The accretion luminosities of MBHs in dwarfs are low throughout cosmic time, rendering them extremely difficult to detect. However, the merger history of these MBHs is optimal for gravitational wave detection by LISA.},

abstract = {The Hubble constant, H0, or its dimensionless equivalent, "little h", is a fundamental cosmological property that is now known to an accuracy better than a few percent. Despite its cosmological nature, little h commonly appears in the measured properties of individual galaxies. This can pose unique challenges for users of such data, particularly with survey data. In this paper we show how little h arises in the measurement of galaxies, how to compare like-properties from different datasets that have assumed different little h cosmologies, and how to fairly compare theoretical data with observed data, where little h can manifest in vastly different ways. This last point is particularly important when observations are used to calibrate galaxy formation models, as calibrating with the wrong (or no) little h can lead to disastrous results when the model is later converted to the correct h cosmology. We argue that in this modern age little h is an anachronism, being one of least uncertain parameters in astrophysics, and we propose that observers and theorists instead treat this uncertainty like any other. We conclude with a "cheat sheet" of nine points that should be followed when dealing with little h in data analysis.},

abstract = {We present results from high-resolution N-Body/SPH simulations of rotationally supported dwarf irregular galaxies moving on bound orbits in the massive dark matter halo of the Milky Way.The dwarf models span a range in disk surface density and the masses and sizes of their dark halos are consistent with the predictions of cold dark matter cosmogonies. We show that the strong tidal field of the Milky Way determines severe mass loss in their halos and disks and induces bar and bending instabilities that transform low surface brightness dwarfs (LSBs) into dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) and high surface brightness dwarfs (HSBs) into dwarf ellipticals (dEs) in less than 10 Gyr. The final central velocity dispersions of the remnants are in the range 8-30 km/s and their final {\$}v/\backslashsigma{\$} falls to values {\$}{\textless} 0.5{\$}, matching well the kinematics of early-type dwarfs. The transformation requires the orbital time of the dwarf to be {\$}\backslashsimlt 3-4{\$} Gyr, which implies a halo as massive and extended as predicted by hierarchical models of galaxy formation to explain the origin of even the farthest dSph satellites of the Milky Way, Leo I and Leo II. Only dwarfs with central dark matter densities as high as those of Draco and Ursa Minor can survive for 10 Gyr in the proximity of the Milky Way: this is naturally achieved within hierarchical models, where the densest objects should have small orbital times due to their early formation epochs. Part of the gas is stripped and part is funneled to the center due to the bar, generating one strong burst of star formation in HSBs and smaller, multiple bursts in LSBs. Extended low-surface brightness stellar and gaseous streams originate from LSBs and, when projected along the line of sight, can lead to overestimate the mass-to-light ratio of the bound remnant by a factor {\$}\backslashsimlt 2{\$},},

abstract = {The evolution of dwarf satellites of the Milky Way is affected by the combination of ram pressure and tidal stripping, and internal feedback from massive stars. We investigate gas loss processes in the smallest satellites of the Milky Way using three-dimensional, high resolution, idealized wind tunnel simulations, accounting for gas loss through both ram pressure stripping and expulsion by supernova feedback. Using initial conditions appropriate for a dwarf galaxy like Leo T, we investigate whether or not environmental gas stripping and internal feedback can quench these low mass galaxies on the expected timescales, shorter than 2 Gyr. We find that supernova feedback contributes negligibly to the stripping rate for these low star formation rate galaxies. However, we also find that ram pressure stripping is less efficient than expected in the stripping scenarios we consider. Our work suggests that, although ram pressure stripping can eventually completely strip these galaxies, other physics is likely at play to reconcile our computed stripping times with the rapid quenching timescales deduced from observations of low mass Milky Way dwarf galaxies. We discuss the roles additional physics may play in this scenario, including host-satellite tidal interactions, cored vs. cuspy dark matter profiles, reionization, and satellite pre-processing. We conclude that a proper accounting of these physics together is necessary to understand the quenching of low mass Milky Way satellites.},

abstract = {The kinematics of tidal tails in colliding galaxies has been studied via Fabry-P{\'{e}}rot observations of the H$\alpha$ emission. With their large field of view and high spatial resolution, the Fabry-P{\'{e}}rot data allow us to probe simultaneously, in 2D, two kinematical features of the tidal ionized gas: large-scale velocity gradients due to streaming motions along the tails, and small-scale motions related to the internal dynamics of giant HII regions within the tails. In several interacting systems, massive (109 M ⊙) condensations of HI, CO and stars are observed in the outer regions of tails. Whether they are genuine accumulations of matter or not is still debated. Indeed a part of the tidal tail may be aligned with the line-of-sight, and the associated projection effect may result in apparent accumulations of matter that does not exist in the 3D space. Using numerical simulations, we show that studying the large-scale kinematics of tails, it is possible to know whether these accumulations of matter are the result of projection effects or not. We conclude that several ones (Arp 105-South, Arp 242, NGC 7252, and NGC 5291-North) are genuine accumulations of matter. We also study the small-scale motions inside these regions: several small-scale velocity gradients are identified with projected values as large as 50-100 km s -1 accross the observed HII regions. In the case of NGC 5291-North, the spatial resolution of our observations is sufficient to detail the velocity field; we show that this system is rotating and self-gravitating, and discuss its dark matter content. The Fabry-P{\'{e}}rot observations have thus enabled us to prove that some 109 M⊙ condensations of matter are real structures, and are kinematically decoupled from the rest of the tail. Such massive and self-gravitating objects are the progenitors of the so-called "Tidal Dwarf Galaxies".},

abstract = {A major problem in extragalactic astronomy is the inability to distinguish in a robust, physical, and model independent way how galaxy populations are related to each other and to their formation histories. A similar, but distinct, and also long standing question is whether the structural appearances of galaxies, as seen through their stellar light distributions, contain enough physical information to offer this classification. We argue through the use of 240 images of nearby galaxies that three model independent parameters measured on a single galaxy image reveal its major ongoing and past formation modes, and can be used as a robust classification system. These parameters quantitatively measure: the concentration (C), asymmetry (A) and clumpiness (S) of a galaxy's stellar light distribution. When combined into a three dimensional `CAS' volume all major classes of galaxies in various phases of evolution are cleanly distinguished. We argue that these three parameters correlate with important modes of galaxy evolution: star formation and major merging activity. This is argued through the strong correlation of Halpha equivalent width and broad band colors with the clumpiness parameter, the uniquely large asymmetries of 66 galaxies undergoing mergers, and the correlation of bulge to total light ratios, and stellar masses, with the concentration index. As an obvious goal is to use this system at high redshifts to trace evolution, we demonstrate that these parameters can be measured, within a reasonable and quantifiable uncertainty, with available data out to z {\~{}} 3 using the Hubble Space Telescope GOODS ACS and Hubble Deep Field images.},

We supplement the simulations with a realistic mass–size relation for galaxies at the time of infall into the cluster, as well as an analytical model to describe the tidally induced evolution of their stellar mass, velocity dispersion, and size. The model assumes ‘cuspy' NFW haloes and, contrary to recent claims, has no difficulty reproducing the observed number of UDGs in clusters. Our results further suggest that the UDG population consists of a mixture of ‘normal' low surface brightness galaxies such as those found in the field (‘born' UDGs, or B-UDGs), as well as a distinct population that owe their large size and low surface brightness to the effects of cluster tides (‘tidal', or T-UDGs). The simulations indicate that T-UDGs entered the cluster earlier and should be more prevalent than B-UDGs near the cluster centres. T-UDGs should also have, at given stellar mass, lower velocity dispersion, higher metallicities, and lower dark matter content than B-UDGs. Our results suggest that systems like DF-44 are consistent with having been born as UDGs, while others such as DF2, DF4, and VLSB-D are possibly extreme T-UDG examples.},

abstract = {We address the origin of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), which have stellar masses typical of dwarf galaxies but effective radii of Milky Way-sized objects. Their formation mechanism, and whether they are failed L* galaxies or diffuse dwarfs, are challenging issues. Using zoomin cosmological simulations from the Numerical Investigation of a Hundred Astrophysical Objects (NIHAO) project, we show that UDG analogues form naturally in dwarf-sized haloes due to episodes of gas outflows associated with star formation. The simulated UDGs live in isolated haloes of masses 1010-11 M⊙, have stellar masses of 107-8.5 M⊙, effective radii larger than 1 kpc and dark matter cores. They show a broad range of colours, an average S{\'{e}}rsic index of 0.83, a typical distribution of halo spin and concentration, and a non-negligible HI gas mass of 107-9 M⊙, which correlates with the extent of the galaxy. Gas availability is crucial to the internal processes which form UDGs: feedback-driven gas outflows, and subsequent dark matter and stellar expansion, are the key to reproduce faint, yet unusually extended, galaxies. This scenario implies that UDGs represent a dwarf population of low surface brightness galaxies and should exist in the field. The largest isolated UDGs should contain more HI gas than less extended dwarfs of similar M*.},

abstract = {The transformations taking place in late-type galaxies in the environment of rich clusters of galaxies at z=0 are reviewed. From the handful of late-type galaxies that inhabit local clusters, whether they were formed in-situ and survived as such, avoiding transformation or even destruction or if they are newcomers that recently infall from outside, we can learn an important lesson on the latest stages of galaxy evolution. We start by reviewing the observational scenario, covering the broadest possible stretch of the electromagnetic spectrum, from the gas tracers, the star formation tracers, the old star tracers and the dust. Strong emphasis is given to the three nearby, well studied clusters Virgo, A1367 and Coma, representative of different evolutionary stages, from unrelaxed, spiral rich (Virgo) to relaxed, spiral poor clusters (Coma). We continue by providing a review of models of galaxy interactions relevant to clusters of galaxies. Prototypes of various mechanisms and processes are discussed and their typical time-scales are given in an Appendix. Observations indicate the presence of healthy late-type galaxies falling into nearby clusters individually or belonging to massive groups. More rare are infalling galaxies belonging to compact groups where significant pre-processing might take place. Once entered the cluster, they loose their gas and quench their star formation activity, becoming anemics. Observations and theory agree in indicating that the interaction with the intergalactic medium is responsible for the gas depletion. This process, however, cannot be at the origin of the cluster lenticular galaxy population. Physical and statistical properties of S0 in nearby clusters and at higher redshift, indicate that they originate from spiral galaxies transformed by gravitational interactions.},

We present its spectacular extraplanar tails of ionized and molecular gas, UV stellar light, X-ray and radio continuum emission. This galaxy represents an excellent laboratory to study the interplay between different gas phases and star formation, and the influence of gas stripping, gas heating, and AGN. We analyze the physical origin of the emission at different wavelengths in the tail, in particular in-situ star formation (related to H$\alpha$, CO and UV emission), synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons (producing the radio continuum) and heating of the stripped interstellar medium (ISM) (responsible for the X-ray emission). We show the similarities and differences of the spatial distributions of ionized gas, molecular gas and UV light, and argue that the mismatch on small scales (1kpc) is due to different stages of the star formation process. We present the relation H$\alpha$–X-ray surface brightness, which is steeper for star-forming regions than for diffuse ionised gas regions with high [OI]/H$\alpha$ ratio. We propose that ISM heating due to interaction with the intracluster medium (either for mixing, thermal conduction or shocks) is responsible for the X-ray tail, the observed [OI]excess and the lack of star formation in the northern part of the tail. We also report the tentative discovery in the tail of the most distant (and among the brightest) currently known ULX, a point-like ultraluminous X-ray source commonly originating in a binary stellar system powered either by an intermediate-mass black hole or a magnetized neutron star.},

RomulusC, a zoom-in simulation of a halo with {\$}z=0{\$} mass {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}14{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, is run with the same sub-grid physics and resolution as Romulus25 (Tremmel et al. 2017). With unprecedented mass and spatial resolution, RomulusC represents a unique opportunity to study the evolution of galaxies in dense environments down to dwarf masses. We demonstrate that RomulusC results in an intracluster medium (ICM) consistent with observations. The star formation history and stellar mass of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) is consistent with observations and abundance matching results, indicating that our sub-grid models, optimized only to reproduce observations of field dwarf and Milky Way mass galaxies, are able to produce reasonable galaxy masses and star formation histories in much higher mass systems. Feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) regulates star formation by driving large-scale, collimated outflows that coexist with a low entropy core. We find that non-BCG cluster member galaxies are substantially quenched compared to the field down to dwarf galaxy masses and, at low masses, quenching is seen to have no dependence on mass or distance from the cluster center. This enhanced quenched population extends beyond {\$}R{\_}{\{}200{\}}{\$} and is in place at high redshift. Similarly, we predict that SMBH activity is significantly suppressed within clusters outside of the BCG, but show how the effect could be lost when only focusing on the brightest AGN in the most massive galaxies.},

abstract = {We describe two peculiar galaxies falling into the massive galaxy clusters Abell 1689 (z ≈ 0.18) and Abell 2667 (z ≈ 0.23), respectively. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images show extraordinary trails composed of bright blue knots (-16.5 {\textless} M {\textless} -11.5 mag) and stellar streams associated with each of these systems. Combining optical, near- and mid-infrared and radio observations we prove that while both galaxies show similar extended trails of star-forming knots, their recent star formation histories are different. One (≈L*) is experiencing a strong burst of star formation, appearing as a rare example of a luminous infrared cluster galaxy. In comparison, the other (≈0.1L*) has recently ceased its star formation activity. Our model suggests that the morphologies and star formation in these galaxies have been influenced by the combined action of tidal interaction (likely with the cluster potential) and of ram pressure with the intracluster medium (ICM). These results can be used to gain more insights to the origin of S0s, dwarf and ultracompact dwarf (UCD) cluster galaxies. {\textcopyright} 2007 RAS.},

abstract = {Galaxies moving through the intracluster medium (ICM) of a cluster of galaxies can lose gas via ram pressure stripping. This stripped gas forms a tail behind the galaxy which is potentially observable. In this paper, we carry out hydrodynamical simulations of a galaxy undergoing stripping with a focus on the gas properties in the wake and their observational signatures. We include radiative cooling in an adaptive hydrocode in order to investigate the impact of a clumpy, multi-phase interstellar medium. We find that including cooling results in a very different morphology for the gas in the tail, with a much wider range of temperatures and densities. The tail is significantly narrower in runs with radiative cooling, in agreement with observed wakes. In addition, we make detailed predictions of H I, H$\alpha$, and X-ray emission for the wake, showing that we generally expect detectable H I and H$\alpha$ signatures, but no observable X-ray emission (at least for our chosen ram pressure strength and ICM conditions). We find that the relative strength of the H$\alpha$ diagnostic depends somewhat on our adopted minimum temperature floor (below which we set cooling to zero to mimic physics processes not included in the simulation).},

As a general feature, the IMF is well described by a power-law form for {\$}m\backslashga 1 \backslashmsol{\$} and a lognormal form below. The extension of the disk IMF into the brown dwarf (BD) regime is in good agreement with observations and yields a disk BD number-density comparable to the stellar one {\$}\backslashsim 0.1 \backslashpc3{\$}. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. Within all the uncertainties, it is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters, and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk. The IMF characteristic of early star formation remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below {\$}\backslashsim 1 \backslashmsol{\$}. These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The M/L ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8 and 1.4 smaller than a Salpeter IMF, respectively. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. (shortened)},

The formation and sustainability of the metallicity gradients and kinetically distinct stellar populations are also tackled. We show how the properties of six Local Group dwarf galaxies, NGC 6622, Andromeda II, Sculptor, Sextans, Ursa Minor and Draco are reproduced, and how they pertain to three main galaxy build-up modes. Our results indicate that the interaction with a massive central galaxy could be needed for a handful of Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies only, the vast majority of the systems and their variety of star formation histories arising naturally from a {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM framework.

abstract = {Context. Using MegaCam at the CFHT, we obtained a deep narrow band H$\alpha$+[NII] wide-field image of NGC 4569 (M90), the brightest late-type galaxy in the Virgo cluster. The image reveals the presence of long tails of diffuse ionized gas, without any associated stellar component extending from the disc of the galaxy up to 80 kpc (projected distance) and with a typical surface brightness of a few 10-18 erg s-1 cm-2 arcsec-2. These features provide direct evidence that NGC 4569 is undergoing a ram-presure stripping event. The image also shows a prominent 8 kpc spur of ionized gas that is associated with the nucleus that spectroscopic data identify as an outflow. With some assumptions on the 3D distribution of the gas, we use the H$\alpha$ surface brightness of these extended low-surface brightness features to derive the density and the mass of the gas that has been stripped during the interaction of the galaxy with the intracluster medium. The comparison with ad hoc chemo-spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution indicates that the mass of the H$\alpha$ emitting gas in the tail is a large fraction of that of the cold phase that has been stripped from the disc, suggesting that the gas is ionized within the tail during the stripping process. The lack of star forming regions suggests that mechanisms other than photoionization are responsible for the excitation of the gas (shocks, heat conduction, magneto hydrodynamic waves). This analysis indicates that ram pressure stripping is efficient in massive (Mstar 1010.5 M⊙) galaxies located in intermediate-mass (1014 M⊙) clusters under formation. It also shows that the mass of gas expelled by the nuclear outflow is only {\~{}}1{\%} than that removed during the ram pressure stripping event.Together these results indicate that ram pressure stripping, rather than starvation through nuclear feedback, can be the dominant mechanism that is responsible for the quenching of the star formation activity of galaxies in high density environments.},

abstract = {We present deep photometry in the B, V and I filters from CTIO/MOSAIC for about 270 000 stars in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy, out to a radius of rell ≈ 0.8 degrees. By combining the accurately calibrated photometry with the spectroscopic metallicity distributions of individual red giant branch stars we obtain the detailed star formation and chemical evolution history of Fornax. Fornax is dominated by intermediate age (1-10 Gyr) stellar populations, but also includes ancient (10-14 Gyr), and young (=1 Gyr) stars. We show that Fornax displays a radial age gradient, with younger, more metal-rich populations dominating the central region. This confirms results from previous works. Within an elliptical radius of 0.8 degrees, or 1.9 kpc from the centre, a total mass in stars of 4.3 × 107 M⊙ was formed, from the earliest times until 250 Myr ago. Using the detailed star formation history, age estimates are determined for individual stars on the upper RGB, for which spectroscopic abundances are available, giving an age-metallicity relation of the Fornax dSph from individual stars. This shows that the average metallicity of Fornax went up rapidly from [Fe/H] ≤-2.5 dex to [Fe/H] =-1.5 dex between 8-12 Gyr ago, after which a more gradual enrichment resulted in a narrow, well-defined sequence which reaches [Fe/H] ≈-0.8 dex, ≈3 Gyr ago. These ages also allow us to measure the build-up of chemical elements as a function of time, and thus determine detailed timescales for the evolution of individual chemical elements. A rapid decrease in [Mg/Fe] is seen for the stars with [Fe/H] ≥-1.5 dex, with a clear trend in age. {\textcopyright} 2012 ESO.},

SFDGs in low-density regions are still assembling their mass, they often show peculiar gas morphology and kinematics, likely associated to external gas accretion or galaxy interactions, and they can experience strong bursts of star formation. The most metal-poor SFDGs are found in the field and they are unique laboratories to investigate the star formation process in the low-metallicity regime, at conditions similar to their high-redshift analogues. On the other hand, SFDGs in intermediate- and high-density environments provide a key to understand the processes that remove their interstellar medium (ISM) and suppress star formation, leading to the different types of gas-poor early-type dwarfs. We review the most recent results on the properties of SFDGs at low and high galaxy densities focusing in particular on the impact of a cluster environment on their ISM components (dust, molecular, atomic and ionised gas). We analyse the population of SFDGs in the nearest rich clusters: Virgo, which is still in the process of assembly, and Fornax, which is more dynamically evolved, more compact and denser. We discuss how the different evolutionary stage of the two structures affects the properties of SFDGs.},

abstract = {Observationally, the quenching of star-forming galaxies appears to depend both on their mass and environment. The exact cause of the environmental dependence is still poorly understood, yet semi-analytic models (SAMs) of galaxy formation need to parameterise it to reproduce observations of galaxy properties. In this work, we use hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the quenching of disk galaxies through ram-pressure stripping (RPS) as they fall into galaxy clusters with the goal of characterising the importance of this effect for the reddening of disk galaxies. Our set-up employs a live model of a galaxy cluster that interacts with infalling disk galaxies on different orbits. We use the moving-mesh code AREPO, augmented with a special refinement strategy to yield high resolution around the galaxy on its way through the cluster in a computationally efficient way. Our direct simulations differ substantially from stripping models employed in current SAMs, which in most cases overpredict the mass loss from RPS. Furthermore, after pericentre passage, as soon as ram pressure becomes weaker, gas that remains bound to the galaxy is redistributed to the outer parts, an effect that is not captured in simplified treatements of RPS. Star formation in our model galaxies is quenched mainly because the hot gas halo is stripped, depriving the galaxy of its gas supply. The cold gas disk is only stripped completely in extreme cases, leading to full quenching and significant reddening on timescale of {\~{}}200 Myr. On the other hand, galaxies experiencing only mild ram pressure actually show an enhanced star formation rate that is consistent with observations and are quenched on timescales {\textgreater} 1 Gyr. Stripped gas in the wake is mixed efficiently with intracluster gas already a few tens of kpc behind the disk, and this gas is free of residual star formation.},

abstract = {The dynamics of globular cluster systems (GCSs) around galaxies are often used to assess the total enclosed mass, and even to constrain the dark matter distribution. The GCS of a galaxy is typically assumed to be in dynamical equilibrium within the potential of the host galaxy. However cluster galaxies are subjected to a rapidly evolving and, at times, violently destructive tidal field. We investigate the impact of the harassment on the dynamics of GCs surrounding early-type cluster dwarfs, using numerical simulations. We find that the dynamical behaviour of the GCS is strongly influenced by the fraction of bound dark matter fDM remaining in the galaxy. Only when fDM falls to ∼15 per cent do stars and GCs begin to be stripped. Still the observed GC velocity dispersion can be used to measure the true enclosed mass to within a factor of 2, even when fDM falls as low as ∼3 per cent. This is possible partly because unbound GCs quickly separate from the galaxy body. However even the distribution of bound GCs may spatially expand by a factor of 2–3. Once fDM falls into the {\textless}3 per cent regime, the galaxy is close to complete disruption, and GCS dynamics can no longer be used to reliably estimate the enclosed mass. In this regime, the remaining bound GCS may spatially expand by a factor of 4 to 8. It may be possible to test if a galaxy is in this regime by measuring the dynamics of the stellar disc. We demonstrate that if a stellar disc is rotationally supported, it is likely that a galaxy has sufficient dark matter that the dynamics of the GCS can be used to reliably estimate the enclosed mass.},

abstract = {We present three-integral dynamical models for the three Local Group dwarf elliptical galaxies: NGC 147, 185 and 205. These models are fitted to the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) J-band surface-brightness distribution and the major-axis kinematics (mean streaming velocity and velocity dispersion) and, in the case of NGC 205, also to the minor-axis kinematics. The kinematical information extends out to 2R e in the case of NGC 205 and out to about 1R e in the case of NGC 147 and 185. It is the first time models are constructed for the Local Group dwarf ellipticals (dEs) that allow for the presence of dark matter at large radii and that are constrained by kinematics out to at least one half-light radius. The B-band mass-to-light ratios of all the three galaxies are rather similar, (M/L) B ≈ 3-4 M /L , B. Within the inner two half-light radii, about 40-50 per cent of the mass is in the form of dark matter, so dEs contain about as much dark matter as bright ellipticals. Based on their appreciable apparent flattening, we modelled NGC 205 and 147 as being viewed edge-on. For NGC 185, having a much rounder appearance on the sky, we produced models for different inclinations. NGC 205 and 147 have a relatively isotropic velocity dispersion tensor within the region where the internal dynamics are strongly constrained by the data. Our estimated inclination for NGC 185 is i ≈ 50 • because in that case the model has an intrinsic flattening close to the peak of the intrinsic shape distribution of dEs and it, like the best-fitting models for NGC 147 and 205, is nearly isotropic. We also show that the dynamical properties of the bright nucleus of NGC 205 are not unlike those of a massive globular cluster.},

abstract = {The Fornax Deep Survey (FDS), an imaging survey in the u', g', r', and i'-bands, has a supreme resolution and image depth compared to the previous spatially complete Fornax Cluster Catalog (FCC). Our new data allows us to study the galaxies down to r'-band magnitude m{\$}{\_}{\{}r'{\}}\backslashapprox{\$}21 mag (M{\$}{\_}{\{}r'{\}}\backslashapprox{\$}-10.5 mag). These data provide an important legacy dataset to study the Fornax cluster. We aim to present the Fornax Deep Survey (FDS) dwarf galaxy catalog, focusing on explaining the data reduction and calibrations, assessing the quality of the data, and describing the methods used for defining the cluster memberships for the catalog objects. As a first step we used the SExtractor fine-tuned for dwarf galaxy detection, to find galaxies from the FDS data, covering a 26 deg{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} area of the main cluster, and the area around the Fornax A substructure. We made 2D-decompositions of the identified galaxies using GALFIT. We used color-magnitude, luminosity-radius and luminosity-concentration relations to separate the cluster galaxies from the background galaxies. We then divided the cluster galaxies into early- and late-type galaxies according to their morphology and gave first order morphological classifications. Our final catalog includes 14,095 galaxies. We classify 590 galaxies as being likely Fornax cluster galaxies, of which 564 are dwarfs (M{\$}{\_}{\{}r'{\}}{\$} {\textgreater} -18.5 mag) consisting our Fornax dwarf catalog. Of the cluster dwarfs we classify 470 as early-types, and 94 as late-type galaxies. Our final catalog reaches its 50{\%} completeness limit at magnitude M{\$}{\_}{\{}r'{\}}{\$} = -10.5 mag and surface brightness {\$}\backslashbar{\{}\backslashmu{\}}{\_}{\{}e,r'{\}}{\$} = 26 mag arcsec-2, which is approximately three magnitudes deeper than the FCC. Based on previous works and comparison with a spectroscopically confirmed subsample, we estimate that our final Fornax dwarf galaxy catalog has {\textless} 10{\%} contamination from the background objects.},

abstract = {The recent discovery of diffuse dwarf galaxies that are deficient in dark matter appears to challenge the current paradigm of structure formation in our Universe. We describe the numerical experiments to determine if the so-called dark matter deficient galaxies (DMDGs) could be produced when two gas-rich, dwarf-sized galaxies collide with a high relative velocity of {\$}\backslashsim 300\backslash,{\{}\backslashrm kms{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\}}{\$}. Using idealized high-resolution simulations with both mesh-based and particle-based gravito-hydrodynamics codes, we find that DMDGs can form as high-velocity galaxy collisions separate dark matter from the warm disk gas which subsequently is compressed by shock and tidal interaction to form stars. Then using a large simulated universe IllustrisTNG, we discover a number of high-velocity galaxy collision events in which DMDGs are expected to form. However, we did not find evidence that these types of collisions actually produced DMDGs in the TNG100-1 run. We argue that the resolution of the numerical experiment is critical to realize the "collision-induced" DMDG formation scenario. Our results demonstrate one of many routes in which galaxies could form with unconventional dark matter fractions.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of 47 low surface brightness objects in deep images of a 3° × 3° field centered on the Coma cluster, obtained with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array. The objects have central surface brightness $\mu$(g, 0) ranging from 24-26 mag arcsec-2 and effective radii reff = 3″-10″, as measured from archival Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope images. From their spatial distribution we infer that most or all of the objects are galaxies in the Coma cluster. This relatively large distance is surprising as it implies that the galaxies are very large: with reff = 1.5-4.6 kpc their sizes are similar to those of L∗ galaxies even though their median stellar mass is only ∼6 × 107 M⊙. The galaxies are relatively red and round, with 〈g-i〉 = 0.8 and 〈b/a〉 = 0.74. One of the 47 galaxies is fortuitously covered by a deep Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) observation. The ACS imaging shows a large spheroidal object with a central surface brightness $\mu$475 = 25.8 mag arcsec-2, a S{\'{e}}rsic index n = 0.6, and an effective radius of 7″, corresponding to 3.4 kpc at the distance of Coma. The galaxy is not resolved into stars, consistent with expectations for a Coma cluster object. We speculate that these "ultra-diffuse galaxies" may have lost their gas supply at early times, possibly resulting in very high dark matter fractions.},

abstract = {Within a Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) scenario, we use high resolution cosmological simulations spanning over four orders of magnitude in galaxy mass to understand the deficit of dwarf galaxies in observed velocity functions. We measure velocities in as similar a way as possible to observations, including generating mock HI data cubes for our simulated galaxies. We demonstrate that this apples-to-apples comparison yields an "observed" velocity function in agreement with observations, reconciling the large number of low-mass halos expected in a LCDM cosmological model with the low number of observed dwarfs at a given velocity. We then explore the source of the discrepancy between observations and theory, and conclude that the dearth of observed dwarf galaxies is primarily explained by two effects. The first effect is that galactic rotational velocities derived from the HI linewidth severely underestimate the maximum halo velocity. The second effect is that a large fraction of halos at the lowest masses are too faint to be detected by current galaxy surveys. We find that cored dark matter density profiles can contribute to the lower observed velocity of galaxies, but only for galaxies in which the velocity is measured interior to the size of the core ({\~{}}3 kpc).},

@article{Fritz2017,
abstract = {The so-called jellyfish galaxies are objects exhibiting disturbed morphology, mostly in the form of tails of gas stripped from the main body of the galaxy. Several works have strongly suggested ram pressure stripping to be the mechanism driving this phenomenon. Here, we focus on one of these objects, drawn from a sample of optically selected jellyfish galaxies, and use it to validate SINOPSIS, the spectral fitting code that will be used for the analysis of the GASP (GAs Stripping Phenomena in galaxies with MUSE) survey, and study the spatial distribution and physical properties of gas and stellar populations in this galaxy. We compare the model spectra to those obtained with GANDALF, a code with similar features widely used to interpret the kinematic of stars and gas in galaxies from IFU data. We find that SINOPSIS can reproduce the pixel-by-pixel spectra of this galaxy at least as good as GANDALF does, providing reliable estimates of the underlying stellar absorption to properly correct the nebular gas emission. Using these results, we find strong evidences of a double effect of ram pressure exerted by the intracluster medium onto the gas of the galaxy. A moderate burst of star formation, dating between 20 and 500 Myr ago and involving the outer parts of the galaxy more strongly than the inner regions, was likely induced by a first interaction of the galaxy with the intracluster medium. Stripping by ram pressure, plus probable gas depletion due to star formation, contributed to create a truncated ionized gas disk. The presence of an extended stellar tail on only one side of the disk, points instead to another kind of process, likely a gravitational interaction by a fly-by or a close encounter with another galaxy in the cluster.},

abstract = {We study the star formation quenching mechanism in cluster galaxies by fitting the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the Herschel Reference Survey, a complete volume-limited K-band-selected sample of nearby galaxies including objects in different density regions, from the core of the Virgo cluster to the general field. The SEDs of the target galaxies were fitted using the CIGALE SED modelling code. The truncated activity of cluster galaxies was parametrised using a specific star formation history with two free parameters, the quenching age QA and the quenching factor QF. These two parameters are crucial for the identification of the quenching mechanism, which acts on long timescales when starvation processes are at work, but is rapid and effcient when ram pressure occurs. To be sensitive to an abrupt and recent variation of the star formation activity, we combined twenty photometric bands in the UV to far-infrared in a new way with three age-sensitive Balmer line absorption indices extracted from available medium-resolution (R ∼ 1000) integrated spectroscopy and with H$\alpha$ narrow-band imaging data. The use of a truncated star formation history significantly increases the quality of the fit in HI-deficient galaxies of the sample, that is to say, in those objects whose atomic gas content has been removed during the interaction with the hostile cluster environment. The typical quenching age of the perturbed late-type galaxies is QA ≤ 300 Myr whenever the activity of star formation is reduced by 50{\%} {\textless} QF ≥ 80{\%} and QA ≤ 500 Myr for QF {\textless} 80{\%}, while that of the quiescent early-type objects is QA ' 13 Gyr. The fraction of late-type galaxies with a star formation activity reduced by QF {\textless} 80{\%} and with an HI-deficiency parameter HI de f {\textless} 0:4 drops by a factor of {\textless}5 from the inner half virial radius of the Virgo cluster (R=Rvir {\textless} 0:5), where the hot diffuse X-ray emitting gas of the cluster is located, to the outer regions (R=Rvir {\textless} 4). The efficient quenching of the star formation activity observed in Virgo suggests that the dominant stripping process is ram pressure. We discuss the implication of this result in the cosmological context of galaxy evolution.},

Dwarf spheroids are dark-matter-dominated low luminosity galaxies in the nearby Universe and their origin is one of the outstanding puzzles of how galaxies form. Previous models are relevant only to dwarf spheroidals orbiting close to a giant galaxy like the Milky Way or Andromeda, and are ruled out as general theories because of the existence of dwarfs in the outskirts of the Local Group. In the new model simulations, encounters between dwarf galaxies in small groups excite a 'resonant stripping' process that transforms them into dwarf spheroidals before they are accreted by systems like the Milky Way. Within this framework, dwarf spheroidals should form and interact in pairs or small groups, leaving detectable long stellar streams and tails.},

abstract = {We present the results of H$\alpha$ imaging of a large sample of irregular galaxies. Our sample includes 94 galaxies with morphological classifications of Im, 26 blue compact dwarfs (BCDs), and 20 Sm systems. The sample spans a large range in galactic parameters, including integrated absolute magnitude (MV of -9 to -19), average surface brightness (20-27 mag arcsec-2), current star formation activity (0-1.3 Msolar yr-1 kpc-2), and relative gas content (0.02-5Msolar/LB). The H$\alpha$ images were used to measure the integrated star formation rates, determine the extents of star formation in the disks, and compare azimuthally averaged radial profiles of current star formation to older starlight. The integrated star formation rates of Im galaxies normalized to the physical size of the galaxy span a range of a factor of 104 with 10{\%} Im galaxies and one Sm system having no measurable star formation at the present time. The BCDs fall, on average, at the high star formation rate end of the range. We find no correlation between star formation activity and proximity to other cataloged galaxies. Two galaxies located in voids are similar in properties to the Sm group in our sample. The H II regions in these galaxies are most often found within the Holmberg radius RH, although in a few systems H II regions are traced as far as 1.7RH. Similarly, most of the star formation is found within three disk scale lengths RD, but in some galaxies H II regions are traced as far as 6RD. A comparison of H$\alpha$ surface photometry with V-band surface photometry shows that the two approximately follow each other with radius in Sm galaxies, but in most BCDs there is an excess of H$\alpha$ emission in the centers that drops with radius. In approximately half of the Im galaxies H$\alpha$ and V correspond well, and in the rest there are small to large differences in the relative rate of falloff with radius. The cases with strong gradients in the LH$\alpha$/LV ratios and with high central star formation rate densities, which include most of the BCDs, require a significant fraction of their gas to migrate to the center in the last gigayear. We discuss possible torques that could have caused this without leaving an obvious signature, including dark matter bars and past interactions or mergers with small galaxies or H I clouds. There is now a substantial amount of evidence for these processes among many surveys of BCDs. We note that such gas migration will also increase the local pressure and possibly enhance the formation of massive dense clusters but conclude that the star formation process itself does not appear to differ much among BCD, Im, and Sm types. In particular, there is evidence in the distribution function for H$\alpha$ surface brightness that the turbulent Mach numbers are all about the same in these systems. This follows from the H$\alpha$ distribution functions corrected for exponential disk gradients, which are log-normal with a nearly constant dispersion. Thus, the influence of shock-triggered star formation is apparently no greater in BCDs than in Im and Sm types.},

abstract = {We present the results of a survey of neutral hydrogen emission in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). The survey consists of a mosaic of 320 separate pointings of the 375-m array, resulting in a resolution of 1.6 arcmin (28 pc, for a distance of 60 kpc) over a field of 20 deg{\^{}}2. The rms brightness temperature sensitivity is 1.4 K, corresponding to an Hi column density sensitivity of 4x10{\^{}}18 cm{\^{}}-2 for each velocity channel of width 1.6kms{\^{}}-1. The Hi distribution is complex and, on scales {\textless}{\~{}}1 kpc, appears to be dominated by the effects of expanding Hi shells, which are probably driven by the combined effects of supernovae and stellar winds from massive stars. The picture of the SMC that arises from the current data seems to challenge the earlier belief that the SMC consists of two or more spatially separate structures with different systemic velocities. We find that the observed multiple components are, in many cases, caused by the combined effects of the numerous shells and supershells. Altogether, we identify six supershells (defined here as those with radii greater than 300 pc) and 495 giant shells. For each of these, we measure positions, radii, velocities and expansion rates, and derive ages and kinetic energy requirements. The apparent age distribution of shells is remarkably narrow, with a mean age of 5.4Myr and an intrinsic dispersion of 2Myr. Southern shells appear to be older, on average, by 2.5Myr. The kinetic energy of the shells is a large fraction of the gravitational binding energy of the SMC, implying that further disintegration of the SMC will occur with time, and especially at the next close passage with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) or the Galaxy, unless the SMC possesses a massive halo. Because of their interferometric nature, the images presented here are insensitive to structures of size {\textgreater}{\~{}}0 deg.6, and should not be used for deriving total Hi column densities.},

abstract = {Observations of galaxy isophotes, longs-slit kinematics and high-resolution photometry suggested a possible dichotomy between two dis-tinct classes of E galaxies. But these methods are expensive for large galaxy samples. Instead, integral-field spectroscopic can efficiently rec-ognize the shape, dynamics and stellar population of complete sam-ples of early-type galaxies (ETGs). These studies showed that the two main classes, the fast and slow rotators, can be separated using stel-lar kinematics. We showed there is a dichotomy in the dynamics of the two classes. The slow rotators are weakly triaxial and dominate above Mcrit ≈ 2 × 10 11 M. Below Mcrit, the structure of fast rota-tors parallels that of spiral galaxies. There is a smooth sequence along which, the metals content, the enhancement in $\alpha$-elements, and the " weight " of the stellar initial mass function, all increase with the cen-tral mass density slope, or bulge mass fraction, while the molecular gas fraction correspondingly decreases. The properties of ETGs on galaxy scaling relations, and in particular the (M * , Re) diagram, and their de-pendence on environment, indicate two main independent channels for galaxy evolution. Fast rotators ETGs start as star forming disks and evolve trough a channel dominated by gas accretion, bulge growth and quenching. While slow rotators assemble near the center of massive ha-los via intense star formation at high redshift, and remain as such for the rest of their evolution via a channel dominated by gas poor merg-ers. This is consistent with independent studies of the galaxies redshift evolution.},

Any parameter estimate that is given without an error estimate is meaningless. Nevertheless, many (undergraduate or graduate) students have to teach such methods for error estimation to themselves when working scientifically for the first time. This manuscript presents an easy-to-understand overview of different methods for error estimation that are applicable to both model-based and model-independent parameter estimates. These methods are not discussed in detail, but their basics are briefly outlined and their assumptions carefully noted. In particular, the methods for error estimation discussed are grid search, varying $\chi$ 2 , the Fisher matrix, Monte-Carlo methods, error propagation, data resampling, and bootstrapping. Finally, a method is outlined how to propagate measurement errors through complex data-reduction pipelines.},

abstract = {Long tails and streams of stars are the most noticeable traces of galaxy collisions. However, their tidal origin was recognized only less than 50 years ago and more than 10 years after their first observations. This review describes how the idea of galactic tides has emerged thanks to advances in numerical simulations, from the first simulations that included tens of particles to the most sophisticated ones with tens of millions of them and state-of-the-art hydrodynamical prescriptions. Theoretical aspects pertaining to the formation of tidal tails are then presented. The third part turns to observations and underlines the need for collecting deep multi-wavelength data to tackle the variety of physical processes exhibited by collisional debris. Tidal tails are not just stellar structures, but turn out to contain all the components usually found in galactic disks, in particular atomic/molecular gas and dust. They host star-forming complexes and are able to form star-clusters or even second-generation dwarf galaxies. The final part of the review discusses what tidal tails can tell us (or not) about the structure and the content of present-day galaxies, including their dark components, and explains how they may be used to probe the past evolution of galaxies and the history of their mass assembly. On-going deep wide-field surveys disclose many new low-surface brightness structures in the nearby Universe, offering great opportunities for attempting galactic archeology with tidal tails. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2013.},

abstract = {We present the fully parallel chemo-dynamical Tree/SPH code GEAR, which allows us to perform high resolution simulations with detailed chemical diagnostics. Starting from the public version of Gadget-2, we included the complex treatment of the baryon physics: gas cooling, star formation law, chemical evolution, and supernova feedback. We qualified the performances of GEAR in the case of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) galaxies. Our code GEAR conserves the total energy budget of the systems to better than 5{\%} over 14   Gyr and provides an excellent convergence of the results with numerical resolution. We showed that models of dSphs in a static Euclidean space, where the expansion of the universe is neglected are valid. In addition, we tackled some existing open questions in the field, such as the stellar mass fraction of dSphs and its link to the predicted dark matter halo mass function, the effect of supernova feedback, the spatial distribution of the stellar populations, and the origin of the diversity in star formation histories and chemical abundance patterns. Strong supernova-driven winds seem incompatible with the observed metallicities and luminosities. Despite newly formed stars being preferentially found in the galaxy central parts, turbulent motions in the gas can quickly erase any metallicity gradient. The diversity in properties of dSph are related to a range of total masses, as well as a range of dispersion in the central densities, which is also seen in the halos emerging from a $\Lambda$CDM cosmogony.},

abstract = {We investigate the vorticity of the intergalactic medium (IGM) velocity field on large scales with cosmological hydrodynamic simulation of the concordance model of $\Lambda$CDM. We show that the vorticity field is significantly increasing with time as it can effectively be generated by shocks and complex structures in the IGM. Therefore, the vorticity field is an effective tool to reveal the nonlinear behavior of the IGM, especially the formation and evolution of turbulence in the IGM. We find that the vorticity field does not follow the filament and sheet structures of the underlying dark matter density field and shows highly non-Gaussian and intermittent features. The power spectrum of the vorticity field is then used to measure the development of turbulence in Fourier space. We show that the relation between the power spectra of vorticity and velocity fields is perfectly in agreement with the prediction of a fully developed homogeneous and isotropic turbulence in the scale range from 0.2 to about 3 h -1 Mpc at z ∼ 0. This indicates that the cosmic baryonic field is in the state of fully developed turbulence on scales less than about 3 h -1 Mpc. The random field of the turbulent fluid yields turbulent pressure to prevent the gravitational collapsing of the IGM. The vorticity and turbulent pressure are strong inside and even outside of high density regions. In IGM regions with 10 times mean overdensity, the turbulent pressure can be on an average equivalent to the thermal pressure of the baryonic gas with a temperature of 1.0 × 10 5 K. Thus, the fully developed turbulence would prevent the baryons in the IGM from falling into the gravitational well of dark matter halos. Moreover, turbulent pressure essentially is dynamical and non-thermal, which makes it different from a pre-heating mechanism, as it does not affect the thermal state and ionizing process of hydrogen in the IGM. {\textcopyright} 2010.

As the number of observationally determined stellar abundances continues to climb, these simulations are able to provide new constraints on the early star formaton history and chemical evolution inside both the Milky Way and Local Group dwarf galaxies. Here, we aim to reproduce the low {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-element scatter observed in metal-poor stars.

This threshold occurs at around {\$}10{\^{}}3\backslash,\backslashrm{\{}M{\_}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, a mass limit easily reached in current (and future) simulations. By simulating the Sextans and Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxies we show that this increase in scatter at high resolutions arises from stochastic supernovae explosions. In order to reduce this scatter down to the observed value, we show the necessity of introducing a metal mixing scheme into particle-based simulations. The impact of the method used to inject the metals into the surrounding gas is also discussed. We finally summarise the best approach for accurately reproducing the scatter in simulations of both Local Group dwarf galaxies and in the Milky Way.},

abstract = {Numerical simulations have become a major tool for understanding galaxy formation and evolution. Over the decades the field has made significant progress. It is now possible to simulate the formation of individual galaxies and galaxy populations from well defined initial conditions with realistic abundances and global properties. An essential component of the calculation is to correctly estimate the inflow to and outflow from forming galaxies since observations indicating low formation efficiency and strong circum-glactic presence of gas are persuasive. Energetic 'feedback' from massive stars and accreting super-massive black holes - generally unresolved in cosmological simulations - plays a major role for driving galactic outflows, which have been shown to regulate many aspects of galaxy evolution. A surprisingly large variety of plausible sub-resolution models succeeds in this exercise. They capture the essential characteristics of the problem, i.e. outflows regulating galactic gas flows, but their predictive power is limited. In this review we focus on one major challenge for galaxy formation theory: to understand the underlying physical processes that regulate the structure of the interstellar medium, star formation and the driving of galactic outflows. This requires accurate physical models and numerical simulations, which can precisely describe the multi-phase structure of the interstellar medium on the currently unresolved few hundred parsecs scales of large scale cosmological simulations. Such models ultimately require the full accounting for the dominant cooling and heating processes, the radiation and winds from massive stars and accreting black holes, an accurate treatment of supernova explosions as well as the non-thermal components of the interstellar medium like magnetic fields and cosmic rays.},

abstract = {The known galaxies most dominated by dark matter (Draco, Ursa Minor and Andromeda IX) are satellites of the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxies. They are members of a class of faint galaxies, devoid of gas, known as dwarf spheroidals, and have by far the highest ratio of dark to luminous matter. None of the models proposed to unravel their origin can simultaneously explain their exceptional dark matter content and their proximity to a much larger galaxy. Here we report simulations showing that the progenitors of these galaxies were probably gas-dominated dwarf galaxies that became satellites of a larger galaxy earlier than the other dwarf spheroidals. We find that a combination of tidal shocks and ram pressure swept away the entire gas content of such progenitors about ten billion years ago because heating by the cosmic ultraviolet background kept the gas loosely bound: a tiny stellar component embedded in a relatively massive dark halo survived until today. All luminous galaxies should be surrounded by a few extremely dark-matter-dominated dwarf spheroidal satellites, and these should have the shortest orbital periods among dwarf spheroidals because they were accreted early.},

abstract = {We present 12CO (2-1) data of three Virgo spirals - NGC 4330, NGC 4402 and NGC 4522 obtained using the Submillimeter Array. These three galaxies show clear evidence of ram pressure stripping due to the cluster medium as found in previous H I imaging studies. Using the high-resolution CO data, we investigate how the properties of the inner molecular gas disc change while a galaxy is undergoing H I stripping in the cluster. At given sensitivity limits, we do not find any clear signs of molecular gas stripping. However, both its morphology and kinematics appear to be quite disturbed as those of H I. Morphological peculiarities present in the molecular and atomic gas are closely related with each other, suggesting that the molecular gas can be also affected by strong intracluster medium (ICM) pressure even if it is not stripped. CO is found to be modestly enhanced along the upstream sides in these galaxies, which may change the local star formation activity in the disc. Indeed, the distribution of H$\alpha$ emission, a tracer of recent star formation, well coincides with that of the molecular gas, revealing enhancements near the local CO peak or along the CO compression. FUV and H$\alpha$ share some properties in common, but FUV is always more extended than CO/H$\alpha$ in the three galaxies, implying that the star-forming disc is rapidly shrinking as the molecular gas properties have changed. We discuss how ICM pressure affects dense molecular gas and hence star formation properties while diffuse atomic gas is being removed from a galaxy.},

abstract = {We investigate the structural properties of cluster and group galaxies by studying the Fornax main cluster and the infalling Fornax A group, exploring the effects of galaxy preprocessing in this showcase example. Additionally, we compare the structural complexity of Fornax galaxies to those in the Virgo cluster and in the field. Our sample consists of 582 galaxies from the Fornax main cluster and Fornax A group. We quantified the light distributions of each galaxy based on a combination of aperture photometry, S$\backslash$'ersic+PSF (point spread function) and multi-component decompositions, and non-parametric measures of morphology (Concentration {\$}C{\$}; Asymmetry {\$}A{\$}, Clumpiness {\$}S{\$}; Gini {\$}G{\$}; second order moment of light {\$}M{\_}{\{}20{\}}{\$}), and structural complexity based on multi-component decompositions. These quantities were then compared between the Fornax main cluster and Fornax A group. The structural complexity of Fornax galaxies were also compared to those in Virgo and in the field. Overall, we find significant differences in the distributions of quantities derived from S$\backslash$'ersic profiles ({\$}g'-r'{\$}, {\$}r'-i'{\$}, {\$}R{\_}e{\$}, and {\$}\backslashbar{\{}\backslashmu{\}}{\_}{\{}e,r'{\}}{\$}), and non-parametric indices ({\$}A{\$} and {\$}S{\$}) between the Fornax main cluster and Fornax A group. Moreover, we find significant cluster-centric trends with {\$}r'-i'{\$}, {\$}R{\_}e{\$}, and {\$}\backslashbar{\{}\backslashmu{\}}{\_}{\{}e,r'{\}}{\$}, as well as {\$}A{\$}, {\$}S{\$}, {\$}G{\$}, and {\$}M{\_}{\{}20{\}}{\$} for galaxies in the Fornax main cluster. We find the structural complexity of galaxies increases as a function of the absolute {\$}r'{\$}-band magnitude (and stellar mass), with the largest change occurring between -14 mag {\$}\backslashlesssim M{\_}{\{}r'{\}}\backslashlesssim{\$} -19 mag. This same trend was observed for galaxies in the Virgo cluster and in the field, which suggests that the formation or maintenance of morphological structures (e.g. bulges, bar) is largely dependent on the stellar mass of the galaxies, rather than their environment.},

abstract = {The physics of star formation and the deposition of mass, momentum and energy into the interstellar medium by massive stars (‘feedback') are the main uncertainties in modern cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and evolution1,2. These processes determine the properties of galaxies3,4 but are poorly understood on the scale of individual giant molecular clouds (less than 100 parsecs)5,6, which are resolved in modern galaxy formation simulations7,8. The key question is why the timescale for depleting molecular gas through star formation in galaxies (about 2 billion years)9,10 exceeds the cloud dynamical timescale by two orders of magnitude11. Either most of a cloud's mass is converted into stars over many dynamical times12 or only a small fraction turns into stars before the cloud is dispersed on a dynamical timescale13,14. Here we report high-angular-resolution observations of the nearby flocculent spiral galaxy NGC 300. We find that the molecular gas and high-mass star formation on the scale of giant molecular clouds are spatially decorrelated, in contrast to their tight correlation on galactic scales5. We demonstrate that this decorrelation implies rapid evolutionary cycling between clouds, star formation and feedback. We apply a statistical method15,16 to quantify the evolutionary timeline and find that star formation is regulated by efficient stellar feedback, which drives cloud dispersal on short timescales (around 1.5 million years). The rapid feedback arises from radiation and stellar winds, before supernova explosions can occur. This feedback limits cloud lifetimes to about one dynamical timescale (about 10 million years), with integrated star formation efficiencies of only 2 to 3 per cent. Our findings reveal that galaxies consist of building blocks undergoing vigorous, feedback-driven life cycles that vary with the galactic environment and collectively define how galaxies form stars.},

The simplest models consistent with the current understanding of N-body work on dissipationless clustering, and that of numerical and analytic work on gas evolution and cooling are adopted. Standard models for the evolution of the stellar population are also employed, and new models for the way star formation heats and enriches the surrounding gas are constructed. Detailed results are presented for a cold dark matter universe with Omega = 1 and H(0) = 50 km/s/Mpc, but the present methods are applicable to other models.

Using N-body simulations we follow the evolution of disc galaxies within a $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cluster simulated with 107 particles, where the hierarchical growth and galaxy harassment are modelled self-consistently. Most of the galaxies undergo significant morphological transformation, even at the outskirts of the cluster, and move through the Hubble sequence from late-type discs to dwarf spheroidals. None of the discs is completely destroyed, therefore they cannot be the progenitors of ultracompact dwarf (UCD) galaxies.

abstract = {NGC 1427A is a LMC-like irregular galaxy in the Fornax Cluster with an extended pattern of strong star formation around one of its edges, which is probably due to some kind of interaction with the cluster environment. We present Ha velocities within NGC 1427A, obtained through long-slit spectroscopy at seven different positions, chosen to fall on the brightest H rr regions of the galaxy. Because of its location very near the center of the cluster this object is an excellent candidate to study the effects that the cluster environment has on gas-rich galaxies embedded in it. The rotation of NGC 1427A is modeled in two different ways. The global ionized gas kinematics is reasonably well described by solid-body rotation, although on small scales it shows a chaotic behavior. In this simple model, the collision with a smaller member of the cluster as being responsible for the peculiar morphology of NGC 1427A is very unlikely, since the only candidate intruder falls smoothly into the general velocity pattern of the main galaxy. In a more elaborate model, for which we obtain a better solution, this object does not lie in the same plane of NGC 1427A, in which case we identify it as a satellite bound to the galaxy. These results are discussed in the context of a normal irregular versus one interacting with some external agent. Based on several arguments and quantitative estimates, we argue that the passage through the hot intracluster gas of the Fornax Cluster is a very likely scenario to explain the morphological properties of NGC 1427A, although our kinematical data are not enough to support it more firmly nor rule out the possibility of a normal irregular.},

abstract = {N-Body/SPH simulations are used to study the evolution of dwarf irregular galaxies (dIrr's) entering the dark matter halo of the Milky Way or M31 on plunging orbits. We propose a new dynamical mechanism driving the evolution of gas rich, rotationally supported dIrrs, mostly found at the outskirts of the Local Group (LG), into gas free, pressure supported dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) or dwarf ellipticals (dEs), observed to cluster around the two giant spirals. The initial model galaxies are exponential disks embedded in massive dark matter halos and reproduce nearby dIrrs. Repeated tidal shocks at the pericenter of their orbit partially strip their halo and disk and trigger dynamical instabilities that dramatically reshape their stellar component. After only 2-3 orbits low surface brightness (LSB) dIrrs are transformed into dSphs, while high surface brightness (HSB) dIrrs evolve into dEs. This evolutionary mechanism naturally leads to the morphology-density relation observed for LG dwarfs. Dwarfs surrounded by very dense dark matter halos, like the archetypical dIrr GR8, are turned into Draco or Ursa Minor, the faintest and most dark matter dominated among LG dSphs. If disks include a gaseous component, this is both tidally stripped and consumed in periodic bursts of star formation. The resulting star formation histories are in good qualitative agreement with those derived using HST color-magnitude diagrams for local dSphs.},

abstract = {To gain understanding of the complicated, non-linear, and numerical processes associated with the tidal evolution of dark matter subhaloes in numerical simulation, we perform a large suite of idealized simulations that follow individual N-body subhaloes in a fixed, analytical host halo potential. By varying both physical and numerical parameters, we investigate under what conditions the subhaloes undergo disruption. We confirm the conclusions from our more analytical assessment in van den Bosch et al. that most disruption is numerical in origin; as long as a subhalo is resolved with sufficient mass and force resolution, a bound remnant survives. This implies that state-of-the-art cosmological simulations still suffer from significant overmerging. We demonstrate that this is mainly due to inadequate force softening, which causes excessive mass loss and artificial tidal disruption. In addition, we show that subhaloes in N-body simulations are susceptible to a runaway instability triggered by the amplification of discreteness noise in the presence of a tidal field. These two processes conspire to put serious limitations on the reliability of darkmatter substructure in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. We present two criteria that can be used to assess whether individual subhaloes in cosmological simulations are reliable or not, and advocate that subhaloes that satisfy either of these two criteria be discarded from further analysis. We discuss the potential implications of this work for several areas in astrophysics.},

abstract = {We present new fully self-consistent models of the formation and evolution of isolated dwarf galaxies. We have used the publicly available N-body/SPH code HYDRA, to which we have added a set of star formation criteria, and prescriptions for chemical enrichment (taking into account contributions from both SNIa and SNII), supernova feedback, and gas cooling. The models follow the evolution of an initially homogeneous gas cloud collapsing in a pre-existing dark-matter halo. These simplified initial conditions are supported by the merger trees of isolated dwarf galaxies extracted from the milli-Millennium Simulation. The star-formation histories of the model galaxies exhibit burst-like behaviour. These bursts are a consequence of the blow-out and subsequent in-fall of gas. The amount of gas that leaves the galaxy for good is found to be small, in absolute numbers, ranging between 3x10{\^{}}7 Msol and 6x10{\^{}}7 Msol . For the least massive models, however, this is over 80 per cent of their initial gas mass. The local fluctuations in gas density are strong enough to trigger star-bursts in the massive models, or to inhibit anything more than small residual star formation for the less massive models. Between these star-bursts there can be time intervals of several Gyrs. We have compared model predictions with available data for the relations between luminosity and surface brightness profile, half-light radius, central velocity dispersion, broad band colour (B-V) and metallicity, as well as the location relative to the fundamental plane. The properties of the model dwarf galaxies agree quite well with those of observed dwarf galaxies.},

abstract = {By analysing a sample of galaxies selected from the HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS) to contain more than 2.5 times their expected HI content based on their optical properties, we investigate what drives these HI eXtreme (HIX) galaxies to be so HI-rich. We model the HI kinematics with the Tilted Ring Fitting Code TiRiFiC and compare the observed HIX galaxies to a control sample of galaxies from HIPASS as well as simulated galaxies built with the semianalytic model DARK SAGE. We find that (1) HI discs in HIX galaxies are more likely to be warped and more likely to host HI arms and tails than in the control galaxies, (2) the average HI and average stellar column density of HIX galaxies is comparable to the control sample, (3) HIX galaxies have higher HI and baryonic specific angular momenta than control galaxies, (4) most HIX galaxies live in higher spin haloes than most control galaxies. These results suggest that HIX galaxies are HI-rich because they can support more HI against gravitational instability due to their high specific angular momentum. The majority of the HIX galaxies inherits their high specific angular momentum from their halo. The HI content of HIX galaxies might be further increased by gas-rich minor mergers.

abstract = {We introduce the Virgo Consortium's Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) project, a suite of hydrodynamical simulations that follow the formation of galaxies and supermassive black holes in cosmologically representative volumes of a standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter universe. We discuss the limitations of such simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in which thermal energy is injected into the gas without the need to turn off cooling or decouple hydrodynamical forces, allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we calibrate them to the present-day galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy stellar mass function is reproduced to ≲0.2 dex over the full resolved mass range, 108 {\textless} M*/M⊙ ≲ 1011, a level of agreement close to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic C IV and O VI. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with observations for M* ≳ 109 M⊙ (M* ≳ 1010 M⊙ at intermediate resolution), they are insufficiently steep at lower masses. For the reference model, the gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for galaxy groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. The EAGLE simulation suite, which also includes physics variations and higher resolution zoomed-in volumes described elsewhere, constitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.},

abstract = {We present two new non-parametric methods for quantifying galaxy morphology: the relative distribution of the galaxy pixel flux values (the Gini coefficient or G) and the second-order moment of the brightest 20{\%} of the galaxy's flux (M20). We test the robustness of G and M20 to decreasing signal-to-noise and spatial resolution, and find that both measures are reliable to within 10{\%} at average signal-to-noise per pixel greater than 3 and resolutions better than 1000 pc and 500 pc, respectively. We have measured G and M20, as well as concentration (C), asymmetry (A), and clumpiness (S) in the rest-frame near-ultraviolet/optical wavelengths for 150 bright local "normal" Hubble type galaxies (E-Sd) galaxies and 104 0.05 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.25 ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs).We find that most local galaxies follow a tight sequence in G-M20-C, where early-types have high G and C and low M20 and late-type spirals have lower G and C and higher M20. The majority of ULIRGs lie above the normal galaxy G-M20 sequence, due to their high G and M20 values. Their high Gini coefficients arise from very bright nuclei, while the high second-order moments are produced by multiple nuclei and bright tidal tails. All of these features are signatures of recent and on-going mergers and interactions. We also find that in combination with A and S, G is more effective than C at distinguishing ULIRGs from the "normal" Hubble-types. Finally, we measure the morphologies of 45 1.7 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.8 galaxies from HST NICMOS observations of the Hubble Deep Field North. We find that many of the z {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 2 galaxies possess G and A higher than expected from degraded images of local elliptical and spiral galaxies, and have morphologies more like low-redshift single nucleus ULIRGs.},

The simulations take into account star formation, stellar feedback, radiative cooling and metal enrichment. The dark matter halo initially has a cusped profile, but, at least in these simulations, starting from idealised, spherically symmetric initial conditions, a natural conversion to a core is observed due to gas dynamics and stellar feedback. A degeneracy between the efficiency with which the interstellar medium absorbs energy feedback from supernovae and stellar winds on the one hand, and the density threshold for star formation on the other, is found. We performed a parameter survey to determine, with the aid of the observed kinematic and photometric scaling relations, which combinations of these two parameters produce simulated galaxies that are in agreement with the observations. With the implemented physics we are unable to reproduce the relation between the stellar mass and the halo mass as determined by Guo et al. (2010), however we do reproduce the slope of this relation.},

abstract = {We have used new deep observations of the Coma cluster from Galaxy Evolution Explorer to visually identify 13 star-forming galaxies with asymmetric morphologies in the ultraviolet (UV). Aided by wide-field optical broad-band and H$\alpha$ imaging, we interpret the asymmetric features as being due to star formation within gas stripped from the galaxies by interaction with the cluster environment. The selected objects display a range of structures from broad fan-shaped systems of filaments and knots ('jellyfish') to narrower and smoother tails extending up to 100 kpc in length. Some of the features have been discussed previously in the literature, while others are newly identified here. We assess the ensemble properties of the sample. The candidate stripping events are located closer to the cluster centre than other star-forming galaxies; their radial distribution is more similar to that of all cluster members, dominated by passive galaxies. The fraction of blue galaxies which are undergoing stripping falls from 40 per cent in the central 500 kpc to less than 5 per cent beyond 1 Mpc. We find that tails pointing away from (i.e. galaxies moving towards) the cluster centre are strongly favoured (11/13 cases). From the small number of 'outgoing' galaxies with stripping signatures, we conclude that the stripping events occur primarily on first passage towards the cluster centre, and are short-lived compared to the cluster crossing time. Using galaxy infall trajectories extracted from a cosmological simulation, we find that the observed fraction of blue galaxies undergoing stripping can be reproduced if the events are triggered at a threshold radius of ̃1 Mpc and detectable for ̃500 Myr. Hubble Space Telescope images are available for two galaxies from our sample and reveal compact blue knots coincident with UV and H$\alpha$ emission, apparently forming stars within the stripped material. Our results confirm that stripping of gas from infalling galaxies, and associated star formation in the stripped material, is a widespread phenomenon in rich clusters. Deep UV imaging of additional clusters is a promising route to constructing a statistically powerful sample of stripping events and constraining models for the truncation of star formation in clusters. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

In this brief review, I highlight some of largest calculations carried out recently in the field, and I discuss the challenges involved in making further progress with simulations in the future. These entail the need to scale up the simulations to ever larger sizes and much better resolution, the need to develop more comprehensive numerical models of the physics of galaxy formation, and the need to improve the accuracy of the numerical techniques currently employed.

abstract = {In our modern understanding of galaxy formation, every galaxy forms within a dark matter halo. The formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form. The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided a new window into the statistical relationship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here we define this galaxy-halo connection as the multi-variate distribution of galaxy and halo properties that can be derived from observations and simulations. This connection provides a key test of physical galaxy formation models; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review techniques for inferring the galaxy-halo connection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy formation efficiency is a strong function of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 10{\^{}}12 Msun, less than 20{\%} of the available baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow region around this pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary properties and the connection of these properties to galaxy clustering.},

Our sample of 108 Fornax Cluster members measured with the UK Schmidt Telescope FLAIR-II spectrograph contains 55 dwarf galaxies (15.5{\textgreater}bj{\textgreater}18.0 or -16{\textgreater}Mb{\textgreater}-13.5). Halpha emission shows that 36+/-8 per cent of the dwarfs are star-forming, twice the fraction implied by morphological classifications. The total sample has a mean velocity of 1493+/-36 km/s and a velocity dispersion of 374+/-26 km/s. The dwarf galaxies form a distinct population: their velocity dispersion (429+/-41 km/s) is larger than that of the giants (308+/-30 km/s) at the 98 per cent confidence level. This suggests that the dwarf population is dominated by infalling objects whereas the giants are virialized. The Fornax system has two components; the main Fornax Cluster centered on NGC 1399 with mean velocity 1478 km/s and velocity dispersion 370 km/s, and a subcluster centered 3 degrees to the south-west including NGC 1316 with mean velocity 1583 km/s and velocity dispersion 377 km/s. This partition is preferred over a single cluster at the 99 per cent confidence level. The subcluster, a site of intense star formation, is bound to Fornax and probably infalling towards the cluster core for the first time. We discuss the implications of this substructure for distance estimates of the Fornax Cluster.},

To understand the role that such a tool can play, consider constructing a history for the absolute magnitude of each galaxy within a simulation. The magnitudes must first be calculated for all halos at all timesteps and then linked using a merger tree; folding the required information into a final analysis can entail significant effort. Tangos is a generic solution to this information organization problem, aiming to free users from the details of data management. At the querying stage, our example of gathering properties over history is reduced to a few clicks or a simple, single-line Python command. The framework is highly extensible; in particular, users are expected to define their own properties which tangos will write into the database. A variety of parallelization options are available and the raw simulation data can be read using existing libraries such as pynbody or yt. Finally, tangos-based databases and analysis pipelines can easily be shared with collaborators or the broader community to ensure reproducibility. User documentation is provided separately.},

abstract = {Recent deep photometry of the dwarf spheroidal Ursa Major II's morphology, and spectroscopy of individual stars, have provided a number of new constraints on its properties. With a velocity dispersion {\$}\backslashsim{\$}6 km s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}, and under the assumption that the galaxy is virialised, the mass-to-light ratio is found to be approaching {\$}\backslashsim{\$}2000 - apparently heavily dark matter dominated. Using N-Body simulations, we demonstrate that the observed luminosity, ellipticity, irregular morphology, velocity gradient, and the velocity dispersion can be well reproduced through processes associated with tidal mass loss, and in the absence of dark matter. These results highlight the considerable uncertainty that exists in measurements of the dark matter content of Ursa Major II. The dynamics of the inner tidal tails, and tidal stream, causes the observed velocity dispersion of stars to be boosted to values of {\$}{\textgreater}{\$}5 km s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} ({\$}{\textgreater}{\$}20 km s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} at times). This effect is responsible for raising the velocity dispersion of our model to the observed values in UMaII. We test an iterative rejection technique for removing unbound stars from samples of UMaII stars whose positions on the sky, and line-of-sight velocities, are provided. We find this technique is very effective at providing an accurate bound mass from this information, and only fails when the galaxy has a bound mass less than 10{\$}{\%}{\$} of its initial mass. However when {\$}{\textless}2{\%}{\$} mass remains bound, mass overestimation by {\$}{\textgreater}{\$}3 orders of magnitude are seen. Additionally we find that mass measurements are sensitive to measurement uncertainty in line-of-sight velocities. Measurement uncertainties of 1-4 km s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} result in mass overestimates by a factor of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}1.3-5.7.},

The statistical models are motivated by and tested on the Hydrangea cosmological hydrodynamical simulation suite. Our models recover the typical time when galaxies in the satellite population are stripped and quenched: stripping in massive ({\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm vir{\}}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}14.5{\}}\backslash,{\{}\backslashrm M{\}}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}) clusters typically occurs at or just before the first pericentric passage, and up to {\$}\backslashsim 4\backslash,{\{}\backslashrm Gyr{\}}{\$} later in low mass ({\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}12.5{\}}\backslash,{\{}\backslashrm M{\}}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}) groups.

abstract = {In the local Universe, galaxies in groups and clusters contain less gas and are less likely to be forming stars than their field counterparts. This effect is not limited to the central group/cluster regions, but is shown by recent observations to persist out to several virial radii. To gain insight into the extent and cause of this large-scale environmental influence, we use a suite of high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to analyse galaxies around simulated groups and clusters of a wide range of mass (log 10Mhost/M⊙ = [13.0, 15.2]). In qualitative agreement with the observations, we find a systematic depletion of both hot and cold gas and a decline in the star-forming fraction of galaxies as far out as ˜5r200 from the host centre. A substantial fraction of these galaxies are on highly elliptical orbits and are not infalling for the first time (˜50 per cent at 2r200, independent of host mass) or are affected by `pre-processing' (less than 10 per cent of galaxies around groups, increasing to ˜50 per cent near a massive cluster), even a combination of these indirect mechanisms does not fully account for the environmental influence, particularly in the case of the hot gas content. Direct ram pressure interaction with an extended gas `halo' surrounding groups and clusters is shown to be sufficiently strong to strip the hot gas atmospheres of infalling galaxies out to ˜5r200. We show that this influence is highly anisotropic, with ram pressure along filaments enhanced by up to a factor of 100 despite significant co-flow of gas and galaxies.},

By jellyfish galaxies, we mean satellites orbiting in massive groups and clusters that exhibit highly asymmetric distributions of gas and gas tails. We use the TNG100 run and select galaxies at redshifts {\$}z\backslashle0.6{\$} with stellar mass exceeding {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}9.5{\}}{\{}\backslashrm M{\_}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} and with host halo masses of {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}13{\}}-10{\^{}}{\{}14.6{\}}\backslash,{\{}\backslashrm M{\_}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}.

About {\$}31\backslash{\%}{\$} of cluster satellites are found with signatures of ram-pressure stripping and gaseous tails stemming from the main luminous bodies. This is a lower limit, since the random orientation entails a loss of about {\$}30\backslash{\%}{\$} of galaxies that in an optimal projection would otherwise be identified as jellyfish. The connection with ram-pressure stripping is further confirmed by a series of findings: jellyfish galaxies are more frequent at intermediate and large cluster-centric distances ({\$}r/R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm 200c{\}}\backslashgtrsim 0.25{\$}); they move through the ICM with larger bulk velocities and Mach numbers than the general cluster population, typically orbiting supersonically and experiencing larger ram pressures. Furthermore, the gaseous tails usually extend in opposite directions to the galaxy trajectory, with no relation between tail orientation and the host's center. The frequency of jellyfish galaxies shows a very weak dependence on redshift {\$}(0\backslashle z\backslashle0.6){\$} but larger fractions of disturbed gaseous morphologies occur in more massive hosts and at smaller satellite masses. Finally, jellyfish galaxies are late infallers ({\$}{\textless} 2.5-3{\$} Gyrs ago, at {\$}z=0{\$}) and the emergence of gaseous tails correlates well with the presence of bow shocks in the ICM.},

abstract = {Aims. We test whether or not realistic analysis techniques of advanced hydrodynamical simulations can alleviate the Too Big To Fail problem (TBTF) for late-type galaxies. TBTF states that isolated dwarf galaxy kinematics imply that dwarfs live in halos with lower mass than is expected in a $\Lambda$ cold dark matter universe. Furthermore, we want to identify the physical mechanisms that are responsible for this observed tension between theory and observations.Methods. We use the moria suite of dwarf galaxy simulations to investigate whether observational effects are involved in TBTF for late-type field dwarf galaxies. To this end, we create synthetic radio data cubes of the simulated moria galaxies and analyse their H i kinematics as if they were real, observed galaxies. Results. We find that for low-mass galaxies, the circular velocity profile inferred from spatially resolved H i kinematics often underestimates the true circular velocity profile, as derived directly from the enclosed mass. Fitting the H i kinematics of moria dwarfs with a theoretical halo profile results in a systematic underestimate of the mass of their host halos. We attribute this effect to the fact that the interstellar medium of a low-mass late-type dwarf is continuously stirred by supernova explosions into a vertically puffed-up, turbulent state to the extent that the rotation velocity of the gas is simply no longer a good tracer of the underlying gravitational force field. If this holds true for real dwarf galaxies as well, it implies that they inhabit more massive dark matter halos than would be inferred from their kinematics, solving TBTF for late-type field dwarf galaxies.},

abstract = {We describe a new method that only focuses on the local region surrounding an infalling dwarf in an effort to understand how the hot baryonic halo alters the chemodynamical evolution of dwarf galaxies. Using this method, we examine how a dwarf, similar to Sextans dwarf spheroidal, evolves in the corona of a Milky Way-like galaxy. We find that even at high perigalacticons the synergistic interaction between ram pressure and tidal forces transform a dwarf into a stream, suggesting that Sextans was much more massive in the past to have survived its perigalacticon passage. In addition, the large confining pressure of the hot corona allows gas that was originally at the outskirts to begin forming stars, initially forming stars of low metallicity compared to the dwarf evolved in isolation. This increase in star formation eventually allows a dwarf galaxy to form more metal rich stars compared to a dwarf in isolation, but only if the dwarf retains gas for a sufficiently long period of time. In addition, dwarfs that formed substantial numbers of stars post-infall have a slightly elevated [Mg/Fe] at high metallicity ([Fe/H] ∼ -1.5).},

The particle-based SPH technique allows an intuitive and simple formulation of hydrodynamics that has excellent conservation properties and can be coupled to self-gravity easily and highly accurately. The Lagrangian character of SPH allows it to automatically adjust its resolution to the clumping of matter, a property that makes the scheme ideal for many applications in astrophysics, where often a large dynamic range in density is encountered. We discuss the derivation of the basic SPH equations in their modern formulation, and give an overview about extensions of SPH developed to treat physics such as radiative transfer, thermal conduction, relativistic dynamics or magnetic fields. We also briefly describe some of the most important applications areas of SPH in astrophysical research. Finally, we provide a critical discussion of the accuracy of SPH for different hydrodynamical problems, including measurements of its convergence rate for important classes of problems.},

abstract = {Compact ellipticals (cEs) are outliers from the scaling relations of early-type galaxies, particularly the mass-metallicity relation which is an important outcome of feedback. The formation of such low-mass, but metal-rich and compact, objects is a long-standing puzzle. Using a pair of high-resolution N-body+gas simulations, we investigate the evolution of a gas-rich low-mass galaxy on a highly radial orbit around a massive host galaxy. As the infalling low-mass galaxy passes through the host's corona at supersonic speeds, its diffuse gas outskirts are stripped by ram pressure, as expected. However, the compactness increases rapidly because of bursty star formation in the gas tidally driven to the centre. The metal-rich gas produced by supernovae and stellar winds is confined by the ram pressure from the surrounding environment, leading to subsequent generations of stars being more metal-rich. After the gas is depleted, tidal interactions enhance the metallicity further via the stripping of weakly-bound, old and metal-poor stars, while the size of the satellite is changed only modestly. The outcome is a metal-rich cE that is consistent with observations. These results argue that classical cEs are neither the stripped remnants of much more massive galaxies nor the merger remnants of normal dwarfs. We present observable predictions that can be used to test our model.},

abstract = {The currently operating X-ray imaging observatories provide us with an exquisitely detailed view of the Megaparsec-scale plasma atmospheres in nearby galaxy clusters. At z {\textless} 0.05, the Chandra's 1″angular resolution corresponds to linear resolution of less than a kiloparsec, which is smaller than some interesting linear scales in the intracluster plasma. This enables us to study the previously unseen hydrodynamic phenomena in clusters: classic bow shocks driven by the infalling subclusters, and the unanticipated "cold fronts," or sharp contact discontinuities between regions of gas with different entropies. The ubiquitous cold fronts are found in mergers as well as around the central density peaks in "relaxed" clusters. They are caused by motion of cool, dense gas clouds in the ambient higher-entropy gas. These clouds are either remnants of the infalling subclusters, or the displaced gas from the cluster's own cool cores. Both shock fronts and cold fronts provide novel tools to study the intracluster plasma on microscopic and cluster-wide scales, where the dark matter gravity, thermal pressure, magnetic fields, and ultrarelativistic particles are at play. In particular, these discontinuities provide the only way to measure the gas bulk velocities in the plane of the sky. The observed temperature jumps at cold fronts require that thermal conduction across the fronts is strongly suppressed. Furthermore, the width of the density jump in the best-studied cold front is smaller than the Coulomb mean free path for the plasma particles. These findings show that transport processes in the intracluster plasma can easily be suppressed. Cold fronts also appear less prone to hydrodynamic instabilities than expected, hinting at the formation of a parallel magnetic field layer via magnetic draping. This may make it difficult to mix different gas phases during a merger. A sharp electron temperature jump across the best-studied shock front has shown that the electron-proton equilibration timescale is much shorter than the collisional timescale; a faster mechanism has to be present. To our knowledge, this test is the first of its kind for any astrophysical plasma. We attempt a systematic review of these and other results obtained so far (experimental and numerical), and mention some avenues for further studies. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We investigate the disruption of group and cluster satellite galaxies with total mass (dark matter plus baryons) above 1010 M in the Hydrangea simulations, a suite of 24 high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations based on the EAGLE model. The simulations predict that ∼50 per cent of satellites survive to redshift z = 0, with higher survival fractions in massive clusters than in groups and only small differences between baryonic and pure N-body simulations. For clusters, up to 90 per cent of galaxy disruption occurs in lower-mass subgroups (i.e. during pre-processing); 96 per cent of satellites in massive clusters that were accreted at z {\textless} 2 and have not been pre-processed survive. Of those satellites that are disrupted, only a few per cent merge with other satellites, even in low-mass groups. The survival fraction changes rapidly from less than 10 per cent of those accreted at high z to more than 90 per cent at low z. This shift, which reflects faster disruption of satellites accreted at higher z, happens at lower z for more massive galaxies and those accreted on to less massive haloes. The disruption of satellite galaxies is found to correlate only weakly with their pre-accretion baryon content, star formation rate, and size, so that surviving galaxies are nearly unbiased in these properties. These results suggest that satellite disruption in massive haloes is uncommon, and that it is predominantly the result of gravitational rather than baryonic processes.},

We report the discovery of 442 UDG candidates in our eight field of views, with 247 of these galaxies lying at projected distances {\textless}1R200 from their host cluster. With the aim of testing theories about their formation, we study the scaling relations of UDGs comparing with different types of galaxies, finding that in the full parameter space they behave as dwarf galaxies and their colours do not seem to correlate with their effective radii. To investigate the influence of the environment on the evolution of UDGs, we analyse their structural properties as functions of the projected clustercentric distance and the mass of their host cluster. We find no systematic trends for the stellar mass nor effective radius as function of the projected distance. However, the fraction of blue UDGs seem to be lower towards the centre of clusters, and UDGs in the inner and outer regions of clusters have different S{\'{e}}rsic index and axial ratio distributions. Specifically, the axial ratio distributions of the outer and inner UDGs resemble the axial ratio distributions of, respectively, late-type dwarfs and dwarf ellipticals in the Fornax Cluster suggesting an environmentally driven evolution and another link between UDGs and dwarf galaxies. In general our results suggest strong similarities between UDGs and smaller dwarf galaxies in their structural parameters and their transformation within clusters.},

These ultra-faint dwarfs are the oldest, most dark matter–dominated, most metal-poor, and least chemically evolved stellar systems known. They therefore provide unique windows into the formation of the first galaxies and the behavior of dark matter on small scales. In this review, we summarize the discovery of ultra-faint dwarfs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in 2005 and the subsequent observational and theoretical progress in understanding their nature and origin. We describe their stellar kinematics, chemical abundance patterns, structural properties, stellar populations, orbits, and luminosity function, as well as what can be learned from each type of measurement. We conclude the following: ▪ In most cases, the stellar velocity dispersions of ultra-faint dwarfs are robust against systematic uncertainties such as binary stars and foreground contamination. ▪ The chemical abundance patterns of stars in ultra-faint dwarfs require two sources of r-process elements, one of which can likely be attributed to neutron star mergers. ▪ Even under conservative assumptions, only a small fraction of ultra-faint dwarfs may have suffered significant tidal stripping of their stellar components. ▪ Determining the properties of the faintest dwarfs out to the virial radius of the Milky Way will require very large investments of observing time with future telescopes. Finally, we offer a look forward at the observations that will be possible with future facilities as the push toward a complete census of the Local Group dwarf galaxy population continues.},

The simulations, which include the effect of baryonic feedback processes, such as gas cooling, star formation, cosmic UV background heating and most importantly physically motivated gas outflows driven by supernovae (SNe), form bulgeless galaxies with DM cores. We show that the stellar and baryonic mass is similar to that inferred from photometric and kinematic methods for galaxies of similar circular velocity. Analyzing the simulations in exactly the same way as the observational sample allows us to address directly the so-called "cusp/core" problem in the LCDM model. We show that the rotation curves of the simulated dwarf galaxies rise less steeply than CDM rotation curves and are consistent with those of the THINGS dwarf galaxies. The mean value of the logarithmic inner density slopes alpha of the simulated galaxies' dark matter density profiles is {\~{}} -0.4 +- 0.1, which shows good agreement with $\backslash$alpha = -0.29 +- 0.07 of the THINGS dwarf galaxies. The effect of non-circular motions is not significant enough to affect the results. This confirms that the baryonic feedback processes included in the simulations are efficiently able to make the initial cusps with $\backslash$alpha {\~{}} -1.0 to -1.5 predicted by dark-matter-only simulations shallower, and induce DM halos with a central mass distribution similar to that observed in nearby dwarf galaxies.},

abstract = {Parzen Windows (PW) is a popular nonparametric density estimation technique. In general the smoothing kernel is placed on all available data points, which makes the algorithm computationally expensive when large datasets are considered. Several approaches have been proposed in the past to reduce the computational cost of PW either by subsampling the dataset, or by imposing a sparsity in the density model. Typically the latter requires a rather involved and complex learning process. In this paper, we propose a new simple and efficient kernel-based method for non-parametric probability density function (pdf) estimation on large datasets. We cover the entire data space by a set of fixed radii hyper-balls with densities represented by full covariance Gaussians. The accuracy and efficiency of the new estimator is verified on both synthetic dataset and large datasets of astronomical simulations of the galaxy disruption process. Experiments demonstrate that the estimation accuracy of the new estimator is comparable to that of the previous approaches but with a significant speed-up. We also show that the pdf learnt by the new estimator could used to automatically find the most matching set in large scale astronomical simulations. {\textcopyright}2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {The Fornax Cluster is the nearest galaxy cluster in the southern sky. NGC 1404 is a bright elliptical galaxy falling through the intracluster medium of the Fornax Cluster. The sharp leading edge of NGC 1404 forms a classical "cold front" that separates 0.6 keV dense interstellar medium and 1.5 keV diffuse intracluster medium. We measure the angular pressure variation along the cold front using a very deep (670$\backslash$,ksec) {\{}$\backslash$sl Chandra{\}} X-ray observation. We are taking the classical approach -- using stagnation pressure to determine a substructure's speed -- to the next level by not only deriving a general speed but also directionality which yields the complete velocity field as well as the distance of the substructure directly from the pressure distribution. We find a hydrodynamic model consistent with the pressure jump along NGC 1404's atmosphere measured in multiple directions. The best-fit model gives an inclination of 33{\$}{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$} and a Mach number of 1.3 for the infall of NGC 1404, in agreement with complementary measurements of the motion of NGC 1404. Our study demonstrates the successful treatment of a highly ionized ICM as ideal fluid flow, in support of the hypothesis that magnetic pressure is not dynamically important over most of the virial region of galaxy clusters.},

abstract = {Context . Dwarf galaxies are the most common type of galaxies in galaxy clusters. Due to their low mass, they are more vulnerable to environmental effects than massive galaxies, and are thus optimal for studying the effects of the environment on galaxy evolution. By comparing the properties of dwarf galaxies with different masses, morphological types, and cluster-centric distances we can obtain information about the physical processes in clusters that play a role in the evolution of these objects and shape their properties. The Fornax Deep Survey Dwarf galaxy Catalog (FDSDC) includes 564 dwarf galaxies in the Fornax cluster and the in-falling Fornax A subgroup. This sample allows us to perform a robust statistical analysis of the structural and stellar population differences in the range of galactic environments within the Fornax cluster. Aims . By comparing our results with works concerning other clusters and the theoretical knowledge of the environmental processes taking place in galaxy clusters, we aim to understand the main mechanisms transforming galaxies in the Fornax cluster. Methods . We have exploited the FDSDC to study how the number density of galaxies, galaxy colors and structure change as a function of the cluster-centric distance, used as a proxy for the galactic environment and in-fall time. We also used deprojection methods to transform the observed shape and density distributions of the galaxies into the intrinsic physical values. These measurements are then compared with predictions of simple theoretical models of the effects of harassment and ram pressure stripping on galaxy structure. We used stellar population models to estimate the stellar masses, metallicities and ages of the dwarf galaxies. We compared the properties of the dwarf galaxies in Fornax with those in the other galaxy clusters with different masses. Results . We present the standard scaling relations for dwarf galaxies, which are the size-luminosity, S{\'{e}}rsic n -magnitude and color-magnitude relations. New in this paper is that we find a different behavior for the bright dwarfs (−18.5 mag {\textless} M r ′ {\textless} −16 mag) as compared to the fainter ones ( M r ′ {\textgreater} −16 mag): While considering galaxies in the same magnitude-bins, we find that, while for fainter dwarfs the g ′− r ′ color is redder for lower surface brightness objects (as expected from fading stellar populations), for brighter dwarfs the color is redder for the higher surface brightness and higher S{\'{e}}rsic n objects. The trend of the bright dwarfs might be explained by those galaxies being affected by harassment and by slower quenching of star formation in their inner parts. As the fraction of early-type dwarfs with respect to late-types increases toward the central parts of the cluster, the color-surface brightness trends are also manifested in the cluster-centric trends, confirming that it is indeed the environment that changes the galaxies. We also estimate the strength of the ram-pressure stripping, tidal disruption, and harassment in the Fornax cluster, and find that our observations are consistent with the theoretically expected ranges of galaxy properties where each of those mechanisms dominate. We furthermore find that the luminosity function, color–magnitude relation, and axis-ratio distribution of the dwarfs in the center of the Fornax cluster are similar to those in the center of the Virgo cluster. This indicates that in spite of the fact that the Virgo is six times more massive, their central dwarf galaxy populations appear similar in the relations studied by us.},

@article{Rosswog2020,
abstract = {We present the methodology and performance of the new Lagrangian hydrodynamics code magma2, a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code that benefits from a number of non-standard enhancements. By default it uses high-order smoothing kernels and wherever gradients are needed, they are calculated via accurate matrix inversion techniques, but a more conventional formulation with kernel gradients has also been implemented for comparison purposes. We also explore a matrix inversion formulation of SPH with a symmetrization in the particle indices that is not frequently used. We find interesting advantages of this formulation in some of the tests, for example, a substantial reduction of surface tension effects for non-ideal particle setups and more accurate peak densities in Sedov blast waves. magma2 uses artificial viscosity, but enhanced by techniques that are commonly used in finite-volume schemes such as reconstruction and slope limiting. While simple to implement, this approach efficiently suppresses particle noise, but at the same time drastically reduces dissipation in locations where it is not needed and actually unwanted. We demonstrate the performance of the new code in a number of challenging benchmark tests including, for example, multidimensional vorticity creating Schulz-Rinne-type Riemann problems and more astrophysical tests such as a collision between two stars to demonstrate its robustness and excellent conservation properties.},

An adiabatic gas fits less closely the extended emissions found from Uhuru data.

We select satellites of masses 109.7 ≤ M*, z = 0/M⊙ ≤ 1011.6 residing in clusters of masses 1014 ≲ M200c, z = 0/M⊙ ≤ 1014.6 at z = 0 and that were discs at accretion according to a kinematic morphology indicator (the circularity fraction). These are traced from the time of accretion to z = 0 and compared to a control sample of central galaxies mass-matched at accretion. Most cluster discs become non-discy by z = 0, in stark contrast with the control discs, of which a significant fraction remains discy over the same timescales. Cluster discs become non-discy accompanied by gas removal and star formation quenching, loss of dark matter and little growth or a loss of stellar mass. In contrast, control discs transform while also losing gas mass and quenching, but growing significantly in dark matter and stellar mass. Most cluster satellites change morphologies on similar timescales regardless of stellar mass, in ∼0.5 − 4 Gyr after accretion. Cluster discs that experienced more numerous and closer pericentric passages show the largest change in morphology. Morphological change in all cases requires the presence of a gravitational perturbation to drive stellar orbits to non-discy configurations, along with gas removal/heating to prevent replenishment of the disc through continued star-formation. For cluster discs, the perturbation is impulsive tidal shocking at pericentres and not tidal stripping of outer disc stellar material, whereas for control discs, a combination of mergers and AGN feedback appears to be the key driving force behind morphological transformations.},

A well defined relationship is found between local galaxy density and galaxy type, which indicates an increasing elliptical and S0 population and a corresponding decrease in spirals with increasing density. Attention is given to evidence which contradicts the interpretation that these gradients in population result from the production of S0 galaxies when spirals are swept of disk gas by an IGM. In addition, as an alternative to the hypothesis of spiral sweeping, it is suggested that the local density/morphological-type relation reflects the long time scale associated with the formation of the disk component of galaxies. Finally, the data also indicate a trend of increasing luminosity of the spheroidal component with increasing local density.},

abstract = {We use a sample of 97 galaxies selected from the ALFALFA 21cm survey to make an accurate measurement of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR). These galaxies are specifically selected to be heavily gas-dominated (Mgas/M* {\textgreater}{\~{}} 2.7) and to be oriented edge-on. The former property ensures that the error on the galactic baryonic mass is small, despite the large systematic uncertainty involved in galactic stellar mass estimates. The latter property means that rotational velocities can be derived directly from the width of the 21cm emission line, without any need for inclination corrections. The resulting linewidth-based BTFR has a slope of alpha = 3.58 +- 0.11, a value that is in agreement with previous literature results. The relation is remarkably tight, with almost all galaxies being located within a perpendicular distance of +- 0.1 dex from the best fit line. The low observational error budget for our sample allows us to establish that, despite its tightness, the measured linewidth-based BTFR has some small (i.e., non-zero) intrinsic scatter. We furthermore find a systematic difference in the BTFR of galaxies with "double-horned" 21cm line profiles --suggestive of flat outer galactic rotation curves-- and those with "peaked" profiles --suggestive of rising rotation curves. Restricting our sample to galaxies in the former category results in a slightly steeper slope of alpha = 3.94 +- 0.14. Overall, the high-accuracy measurement of the BTFR presented in this article is intended as a reliable observational benchmark against which to test theoretical expectations. Here we consider a representative set of semi-analytic models and hydrodynamic simulations in the LCDM context, as well as MOND. In the near future, interferometric follow-up observations of several sample members will allow us to further refine the BTFR measurement, and make sharper comparisons with theoretical models.},

abstract = {Satellite galaxies in groups and clusters are more likely to have low star formation rates (SFR) and lie on the red-sequence than central (field) galaxies. Using galaxy group/cluster catalogs from SDSS DR7, together with a cosmological N-body simulation to track satellite orbits, we examine the star formation histories and quenching timescales of satellites of M{\_}star {\textgreater} 5 x 10{\^{}}9 M{\_}sun at z=0. We first explore satellite infall histories: group preprocessing and ejected orbits are critical aspects of satellite evolution, and properly accounting for these, satellite infall typically occurred at z{\~{}}0.5, or {\~{}}5 Gyr ago. To obtain accurate initial conditions for the SFRs of satellites at their time of first infall, we construct an empirical parametrization for the evolution of central galaxy SFRs and quiescent fractions. With this, we constrain the importance and efficiency of satellite quenching as a function of satellite and host halo mass, finding that satellite quenching is the dominant process for building up all quiescent galaxies at M{\_}star {\textless} 10{\^{}}10 M{\_}sun. We then constrain satellite star formation histories, finding a 'delayed-then-rapid' quenching scenario: satellite SFRs evolve unaffected for 2-4 Gyr after infall, after which star formation quenches rapidly, with an e-folding time of {\textless} 0.8 Gyr. These quenching timescales are shorter for more massive satellites but do not depend on host halo mass: the observed increase in satellite quiescent fraction with halo mass arises simply because of satellites quenching in a lower mass group prior to infall (group preprocessing), which is responsible for up to half of quenched satellites in massive clusters. Because of the long time delay before quenching starts, satellites experience significant stellar mass growth after infall, nearly identical to central galaxies. This fact provides key physical insight into the subhalo abundance matching method.},

@article{Penny2009,
abstract = {We present the results of a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) study of dwarf galaxies in the core of the rich nearby Perseus Cluster, down to M V = -12. We identify 29 dwarfs as cluster members, 17 of which are previously unstudied. All the dwarfs we examine are remarkably smooth in appearance, and lack internal features. This smoothness is quantified by parametric fitting of the two-dimensional light distribution, and through non-parametric structural parameters. The dwarfs in this study are found to be very smooth, and have very low asymmetry and clumpiness values (〈A〉 = 0.03 ± 0.04, 〈S〉 = 0.02 ± 0.09) throughout their entire structure, showing no evidence for internal features or star formation that could be the result of tidal processes or star formation induced by the cluster environment. Based on these observations, and the sizes of these dwarfs, we argue that some of the dwarfs in our sample must have a large dark matter content to prevent disruption by the cluster potential. We derive a new method, independent of kinematics, for measuring the dark matter content of dEs, based on the radius of the dwarf, the projected distance of the dwarf from the cluster centre, and the total mass of the cluster interior to it. We use this method to determine the mass-to-light ratios for 25 of the dwarfs in our sample, the others being too close to bright stars to accurately determine their radii. At their current positions in the cluster, 12 out of 25 of the dwarfs in our sample require dark matter to remain stable against the cluster potential. These 12 dwarfs are all fainter than M V = -14, and nearly all dEs with M V {\textless} -13 require dark matter to survive. We also consider the mass that the dwarfs would require to survive the tidal forces at the centre of the cluster, at a pericentric distance of 35 kpc from the cluster centre. We find that at this distance, the mass-to-light ratios of these dwarfs are comparable to those of the Local Group dSphs, ranging between M ⊙/L ⊙ ≈ 1 and 120. {\textcopyright} 2009 RAS.},

abstract = {We investigate the effect of ram-pressure from the intracluster medium on the stripping of HI gas in galaxies in a massive, relaxed, X-ray bright, galaxy cluster at z = 0.2 from the Blind Ultra Deep HI Environmental Survey (BUDHIES). We use cosmological simulations, and velocity versus position phase-space diagrams to infer the orbital histories of the cluster galaxies. In particular, we embed a simple analytical description of ram-pressure stripping in the simulations to identify the regions in phase-space where galaxies are more likely to have been sufficiently stripped of their HI gas to fall below the detection limit of our survey.We find a striking agreement between the model predictions and the observed location of HI-detected and non-detected blue (late-type) galaxies in phase-space, strongly implying that ram-pressure plays a key role in the gas removal from galaxies, and that this can happen during their first infall into the cluster. However, we also find a significant number of gas-poor, red (early-type) galaxies in the infall region of the cluster that cannot easily be explained with our model of ram-pressure stripping alone. We discuss different possible additional mechanisms that could be at play, including the pre-processing of galaxies in their previous environment. Our results are strengthened by the distribution of galaxy colours (optical and UV) in phase-space, that suggests that after a (gas-rich) field galaxy falls into the cluster, it will lose its gas via ram-pressure stripping, and as it settles into the cluster, its star formation will decay until it is completely quenched. Finally, this work demonstrates the utility of phase-space diagrams to analyse the physical processes driving the evolution of cluster galaxies, in particular HI gas stripping.},

abstract = {We present atomic hydrogen (Hi) observations with the Jansky Very Large Array of one of the jellyfish galaxies in the GAs Stripping Phenomena sample, JO201. This massive galaxy (M = 3:5 1010 M) is falling along the line-of-sight towards the centre of a rich cluster (M200 1:6 1015 M, cl 982 55 km s1) at a high velocity 3363 km s1. Its H emission shows a 40 kpc tail, which is closely confined to its stellar disc and a 100 kpc tail extending further out. We find that Hi emission only coincides with the shorter clumpy H tail, while no Hi emission is detected along the 100 kpc H tail. In total, we measured an Hi mass of MHI = 1:65109 M, which is about 60{\%} lower than expected based on its stellar mass and stellar surface density. We compared JO201 to another jellyfish in the GASP sample, JO206 (of a similar mass but living in a ten times less massive cluster), and we find that they are similarly Hi-deficient. Of the total Hi mass in JO201, about 30{\%} lies outside the galaxy disc in projection. This Hi fraction is probably a lower limit since the velocity distribution shows that most of the Hi is redshifted relative to the stellar disc and could be outside the disc. The global star formation rate (SFR) analysis of JO201 suggests an enhanced star formation for its observed Hi content. The observed SFR would be expected if JO201 had ten times its current Hi mass. The disc is the main contributor of the high star formation effciency at a given Hi gas density for both galaxies, but their tails also show higher star formation effciencies compared to the outer regions of field galaxies. Generally, we find that JO201 and JO206 are similar based on their Hi content, stellar mass, and star formation rate. This finding is unexpected considering their different environments. A toy model comparing the ram pressure of the intracluster medium (ICM) versus the restoring forces of these galaxies suggests that the ram pressure strength exerted on them could be comparable if we consider their 3D orbital velocities and radial distances relative to the clusters.},

Using a Lagrangian formulation, we show that the fabric's behavior as derived from Hooke's Law is analogous to that of spacetime per the Field Equations of General Relativity. The study is conducted in the limit of small strains, or analogously, in the limit of weak and nearly static gravitational fields. The Fabric's Lagrangian outside of inclusions is shown to have the same form as the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian for free space. Properties of the fabric such as strain, stress, vibrations, and elastic moduli are related to properties of gravity and space, such as the gravitational potential, gravitational acceleration, gravitational waves, and the energy density of free space. By introducing a mechanical analogy of General Relativity, we enable the application of Solid Mechanics tools to address problems in Cosmology.},

Precisely defined components also enable better comparisons between observations and simulations. We use a subsample of 18 cosmological zoom-in simulations from the Numerical Investigation of a Hundred Astrophysical Objects (NIHAO) project to derive a robust method for defining stellar kinematic discs in galaxies. Our method uses Gaussian Mixture Models in a 3D space of dynamical variables. The NIHAO galaxies have the right stellar mass for their halo mass, and their angular momenta and S{\'{e}}rsic indices match observations. While the photometric disc-to-total ratios are close to 1 for all the simulated galaxies, the kinematic ratios are around {\~{}}0.5. Thus, exponential structure does not imply a cold kinematic disc. Above M* {\~{}} 109.5 M⊙, the decomposition leads to thin discs and spheroids that have clearly different properties, in terms of angular momentum, rotational support, ellipticity, [Fe/H] and [O/Fe]. At M* ≲ 109.5 M⊙, the decomposition selects discs and spheroids with less distinct properties. At these low masses, both the discs and spheroids have exponential profiles with high minor-to-major axes ratios, i.e. thickened discs.},

We do not find clear differences between the structural parameters of the UDGs in our sample and those of UDGs in other galaxy environments. We find that the dwarf LSB galaxies in our sample are less concentrated in the cluster center than the galaxies with higher surface brightness, and that their number density drops in the core of the cluster. Our findings are consistent with the small UDGs forming the tail of a continuous distribution of less extended LSB galaxies. However, the elongated and distorted shapes of the large UDGs could imply that they are tidally disturbed galaxies.},

abstract = {Cosmic dust is present in many astrophysical objects, and recent observations across the electromagnetic spectrum show that the dust distribution is often strongly three-dimensional (3D). Dust grains are effective in absorbing and scattering ultraviolet (UV)/optical radiation, and they re-emit the absorbed energy at infrared wavelengths. Understanding the intrinsic properties of these objects, including the dust itself, therefore requires 3D dust radiative transfer (RT) calculations. Unfortunately, the 3D dust RT problem is nonlocal and nonlinear, which makes it one of the hardest challenges in computational astrophysics. Nevertheless, significant progress has been made in the past decade, with an increasing number of codes capable of dealing with the complete 3D dust RT problem. We discuss the complexity of this problem, the two most successful solution techniques [ray-tracing (RayT) and Monte Carlo (MC)], and the state of the art in modeling observational data using 3D dust RT codes. We end with an outlook on the bright future of this field. Copyright {\textcopyright}2013 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The presence of blue cores in some dwarf early-type galaxies (dEs) in galaxy clusters suggests the scenario of late-type galaxy infall and subsequent transformation into red, quiescent dEs. We present Gemini Multi-Object Spectrographs long-slit spectroscopy of two dEs with blue cores (dE(bc)s), EVCC 591 and EVCC 516, located at the core and outskirt of the Virgo cluster, respectively. We obtained their internal kinematics along the major axis out to, at least, {\~{}} 1 effective radius. EVCC 591 shows evidence of a kinematically decoupled core (KDC) with a size of 2" (160 pc), exhibiting an inverted pattern for velocity with respect to the main body of its host galaxy. The rotation curve of the stellar component in the inner region of EVCC 591 is steeper than that in the rest of the galaxy. On the other hand, overall velocity profiles of stellar and ionized gas components of EVCC 516 show no signature of significant rotation. The occurrence of a KDC and zero rotation in the internal kinematics along with the central star formation support the scenario of gas-rich dwarf-dwarf mergers in the formation of these two dE(bc)s. Furthermore, evolution of dE(bc)s in a cluster environment into ordinary dEs with KDCs is possible based on their structural properties. We suggest that at least some of the dE(bc)s in the Virgo cluster were formed through dwarf-dwarf mergers in lower density environments before they subsequently fell into the cluster; they were then quenched by subsequent effects within the cluster environment.},

abstract = {Starting from meshfree methods, the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is introduced as a complementary tool for numerical simulation of peculiar hydrodynamic problems: its potential advantages with respect to traditional grid-based techniques are pointed out. The governing fluid dynamic equations are recalled and their numerical discretization in the SPH approximation is illustrated. Further numerical aspects relevant to SPH are also discussed, such as solid boundaries treatment. Finally some applications of the SPH method for simulating engineering hydraulic problems are shown, involving rapidly varied free surface flows with large displacements and impacts, scouring phenomena and interaction with rigid bodies.},

abstract = {This paper presents an overview and introduction to smoothed particle hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics in theory and in practice. Firstly, we give a basic grounding in the fundamentals of SPH, showing how the equations of motion and energy can be self-consistently derived from the density estimate. We then show how to interpret these equations using the basic SPH interpolation formulae and highlight the subtle difference in approach between SPH and other particle methods. In doing so, we also critique several 'urban myths' regarding SPH, in particular the idea that one can simply increase the 'neighbour number' more slowly than the total number of particles in order to obtain convergence. We also discuss the origin of numerical instabilities such as the pairing and tensile instabilities. Finally, we give practical advice on how to resolve three of the main issues with SPMHD: removing the tensile instability, formulating dissipative terms for MHD shocks and enforcing the divergence constraint on the particles, and we give the current status of developments in this area. Accompanying the paper is the first public release of the ndspmhd SPH code, a 1, 2 and 3 dimensional code designed as a testbed for SPH/SPMHD algorithms that can be used to test many of the ideas and used to run all of the numerical examples contained in the paper. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract = {At fixed stellar mass, satellite galaxies show higher passive fractions than centrals, suggesting that environment is directly quenching their star formation. Here, we investigate whether satellite quenching is accompanied by changes in stellar spin (quantified by the ratio of the rotational to dispersion velocity V/$\sigma$) for a sample of massive (M∗ {\textgreater} 1010 M☉) satellite galaxies extracted from the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral field spectrograph (SAMI) Galaxy Survey. These systems are carefully matched to a control sample of main sequence, high V/$\sigma$ central galaxies. As expected, at fixed stellar mass and ellipticity, satellites have lower star formation rate (SFR) and spin than the control centrals. However, most of the difference is in SFR, whereas the spin decreases significantly only for satellites that have already reached the red sequence. We perform a similar analysis for galaxies in the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) hydrodynamical simulation and recover differences in both SFR and spin similar to those observed in SAMI. However, when EAGLE satellites are matched to their true central progenitors, the change in spin is further reduced and galaxies mainly show a decrease in SFR during their satellite phase. The difference in spin observed between satellites and centrals at z ∼ 0 is primarily due to the fact that satellites do not grow their angular momentum as fast as centrals after accreting into bigger haloes, not to a reduction of V/$\sigma$ due to environmental effects. Our findings highlight the effect of progenitor bias in our understanding of galaxy transformation and they suggest that satellites undergo little structural change before and during their quenching phase.},

abstract = {We present, for five spiral galaxies, H I data which, along with the Ha rotation curves, are used to derive the distribution of dark matter within these objects. A new method for extracting rotation curves from Hi data cubes is presented, which takes into account the existence of a warp and minimizes projection effects. The rotation curves obtained are tested by taking them as input in the construction of model data cubes that are compared with the observed ones: the agreement is excellent. Model data cubes built using rotation curves obtained with standard methods, such as the first-moment analysis, however, fail the test. The HI rotation curves agree well with the Ha data, where they coexist. Moreover, the combined H$\alpha$ + HI rotation curves are smooth, symmetric and extend to large radii. The rotation curves are decomposed into stellar, gaseous and dark matter contributions, and the inferred density distribution is compared with various mass distributions: dark haloes with a central density core, A cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) haloes (NFW and Moore profiles), H I scaling and MOND. The observations point to haloes with constant-density cores of size r core ∼ r opt and central densities scaling approximately as $\rho$ 0 $\alpha$ r -2/3. ACDM models (which predict a central cusp in the density profile) are in clear conflict with the data. H I scaling and MOND cannot account for the observed kinematics: we find some counter-examples.},

abstract = {We present predictions for the quenching of star formation in satellite galaxies of the Local Group from a suite of 30 cosmological zoom simulations of MilkyWay-like host galaxies. The Auriga simulations resolve satellites down to the luminosity of the classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies of theMilkyWay. We find strong mass-dependent and distance-dependent quenching signals, where dwarf systems beyond 600 kpc are only strongly quenched below a stellar mass of 107M⊙. Ram pressure stripping appears to be the dominant quenching mechanism and 50 per cent of quenched systems cease star formation within 1 Gyr of first infall. We demonstrate that systems within a host galaxy's R200 radius are comprised of two populations: (i) a first infall population that has entered the host halo within the past few Gyrs and (ii) a population of returning 'backsplash' systems that have had a much more extended interaction with the host. Backsplash galaxies that do not return to the host galaxy by redshift zero exhibit quenching properties similar to galaxies within R200 and are distinct from other external systems. The simulated quenching trend with stellar mass has some tension with observations, but our simulations are able reproduce the range of quenching times measured from resolved stellar populations of Local Group dwarf galaxies.},

Future observational studies will deliver unprecedented insights on the orbits of dwarf companions around the Milky Way, on their star formation histories and on the 3-D internal motions of their stars. Over large volumes, we will assess the impact of local environment on baryon cycling and star formation laws, leading to a full picture of the evolution of dwarfs across cosmic time.

abstract = {Current models of galaxy formation predict satellite galaxies in groups and clusters that are redder than observed. We investigate the effect on the colours of satellite galaxies produced by the ram pressure stripping of their hot gaseous atmospheres as the satellites orbit within their parent halo. We incorporate a model of the stripping process based on detailed hydrodynamic simulations within the Durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. The simulations show that the environment in groups and clusters is less aggressive than previously assumed. The main uncertainty in the model is the treatment of gas expelled by supernovae. With reasonable assumptions for the stripping of this material, we find that satellite galaxies are able to retain a significant fraction of their hot gas for several Gigayears, thereby replenishing their reservoirs of cold, star forming gas and remaining blue for a relatively long period of time. A bimodal distribution of galaxy colours, similar to that observed in SDSS data, is established and the colours of the satellite galaxies are in good agreement with the data. In addition, our model naturally accounts for the observed dependence of satellite colours on environment, from small groups to high mass clusters.},

abstract = {Context. We present the study of a magnitude limited sample (mB ≤ 16.6 mag) of 13 late type galaxies (LTGs), observed inside the virial radius, Rvir ∼ 0.7 Mpc, of the Fornax cluster within the Fornax Deep Survey (FDS). Aims. The main objective is to use surface brightness profiles and g - i colour maps to obtain information on the internal structure of these galaxies and find signatures of the mechanisms that drive their evolution in high-density environments inside the virial radius of the cluster. Methods. By modelling galaxy isophotes, we extract the azimuthally averaged surface brightness profiles in four optical bands. We also derive g - i colour profiles, and relevant structural parameters like total magnitude and effective radius. For ten of the galaxies in this sample, we observe a clear discontinuity in their typical exponential surface brightness profiles, derive their "break radius", and classify their disc-breaks into Type II (down-bending) or Type III (up-bending). Results. We find that Type II galaxies have bluer average (g - i) colour in their outer discs while Type III galaxies are redder. The break radius increases with stellar mass and molecular gas mass while it decreases with molecular gas-fractions. The inner and outer scale-lengths increase monotonically with absolute magnitude, as found in other works. For galaxies with CO(1-0) measurements, there is no detected cold gas beyond the break radius (within the uncertainties). In the context of morphological segregation of LTGs in clusters, we also find that, in Fornax, galaxies with morphological type 5 {\textless} T ≤ 9 (∼60{\%} of the sample) are located beyond the high-density, ETG-dominated regions, however there is no correlation between T and the disc-break type. We do not find any correlation between the average (g - i) colours and cluster-centric distance, but the colour-magnitude relation holds true. Conclusions. The main results of this work suggest that the disc-breaks of LTGs inside the virial radius of the Fornax cluster seem to have arisen through a variety of mechanisms (e.g. ram-pressure stripping, tidal disruption), which is evident in their outer-disc colours and the absence of molecular gas beyond their break radius in some cases. This can result in a variety of stellar populations inside and outside the break radii.},

abstract = {We analyse the orbital distribution of E and S0 galaxies using SAURON integral-field stellar kinematics. We construct the anisotropy (V/sigma,epsilon) diagram, for the 48 E/S0 galaxies from the SAURON survey. For a subsample of 24 galaxies consistent with axisymmetry, we use three-integral axisymmetric Schwarzschild dynamical models to recover the detailed orbital distribution and we find good agreement with the anisotropy derived from the (V/sigma,epsilon) diagram. In the companion Paper IX we show that the early-type galaxies can be subdivided into two classes of systems with or without a significant amount of specific stellar angular momentum. Here we show that the two classes have different distributions on the (V/sigma,epsilon) diagram. The slow rotators are more common among the most massive systems and are generally classified as E from photometry alone. Those in our sample tend to be fairly round (epsilon{\textless}0.3), but can have significant kinematical misalignments, indicating that as a class they are moderately triaxial, and span a range of anisotropies (delta{\textless}0.3). The fast rotators are generally fainter and are classified either E or S0. They can appear quite flattened (epsilon{\textless}0.7), do not show significant kinematical misalignments (unless barred or interacting), indicating they are nearly axisymmetric, and span an even larger range of anisotropies (delta{\textless}0.5). These results are confirmed when we extend our analysis to 18 additional E/S0 galaxies observed with SAURON. All these results support the idea that fast rotators are nearly oblate and contain disk-like components. The role of gas must have been important for their formation. The slow rotators are weakly triaxial. Current collisionless merger models seem unable to explain their detailed observed properties. (Abridged)},

We introduce the Sphenix SPH scheme, which was designed with three key goals in mind: to work well with sub-grid physics modules that inject energy, be highly computationally efficient (both in terms of compute and memory), and to be Lagrangian. Sphenix uses a Density-Energy equation of motion, along with variable artificial viscosity and conduction, including limiters designed to work with common sub-grid models of galaxy formation. In particular, we present and test a novel limiter that prevents conduction across shocks, preventing spurious radiative losses in feedback events. Sphenix is shown to solve many difficult test problems for traditional SPH, including fluid mixing and vorticity conservation, and it is shown to produce convergent behaviour in all tests where this is appropriate. Crucially, we use the same parameters within Sphenix for the various switches throughout, to demonstrate the performance of the scheme as it would be used in production simulations.},

At {\$}\backslashsim\backslash,1.5-2\backslash,\backslashtext{\{}R{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}200{\}}{\}}{\$} of the cluster dark matter halo, we find an extremely steep decline in the halo gas content of infalling haloes and subhaloes irrespective of cluster mass, possibly indicating the presence of an accretion shock. We also find that subhaloes are particularly gas-poor, even in the cluster outskirts, which could indicate active regions of ongoing pre-processing. By modelling the instantaneous ram pressure experienced by each halo and subhalo at {\$}z=0{\$}, we show that the ram pressure intensity is also well correlated with phase-space position, which is again irrespective of cluster mass. In fact, we show that regions in the phase-space plane with high differential velocity between a halo or subhalo and its local gas environment, are almost mutually exclusive with high halo gas content regions. This suggests a causal link between the gas content of objects and the instantaneous ram pressure they experience, where the dominant factor is the differential velocity.},

The tidal stirring model posits that late-type, rotationally-supported dwarfs resembling present-day dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies can transform into dSphs via interactions with Milky Way-sized hosts. Using collisionless N-body simulations, we investigate for the first time how tidal stirring depends on the dark matter (DM) density distribution in the central stellar region of the progenitor disky dwarf. Specifically, we explore various asymptotic inner slopes gamma of the dwarf DM density profiles (rho $\backslash$propto r{\^{}}{\{}-gamma{\}} as r -{\textgreater} 0). For a given orbit inside the primary, rotationally-supported dwarfs embedded in DM halos with core-like density distributions (gamma = 0.2) and mild density cusps (gamma = 0.6) demonstrate a substantially enhanced likelihood and efficiency of transformation into dSphs compared to their counterparts with steeper DM density profiles (gamma = 1). Such shallow DM distributions are akin to those of observed dIrrs, highlighting tidal stirring as a plausible model for the LG morphology-density relation. When gamma {\textless}1, a single pericentric passage can induce dSph formation and disky dwarfs on low-eccentricity or large-pericenter orbits are able to transform into dSphs; these new results allow the tidal stirring model to explain the existence of virtually all known dSphs across a wide range of distances from their hosts. A subset of rotationally-supported dwarfs with gamma {\textless}1 are eventually disrupted by the primary; those that survive as dSphs are generally on orbits that are biased towards lower eccentricities and/or larger pericenters relative to those of typical CDM satellites. The latter could explain the rather peculiar orbits of several classic LG dSphs such as Fornax, Leo I, Tucana, and Cetus.},

abstract = {Based on MUSE data from the GASP survey, we study the H $\alpha$-emitting extraplanar tails of 16 cluster galaxies at z ∼ 0.05 undergoing ram pressure stripping. We demonstrate that the dominating ionization mechanism of this gas (between 64 per cent and 94 per cent of the H $\alpha$ emission in the tails depending on the diagnostic diagram used) is photoionization by young massive stars due to ongoing star formation (SF) taking place in the stripped tails. This SF occurs in dynamically quite cold H II clumps with a median H $\alpha$ velocity dispersion $\sigma$ = 27 km s−1. We study the characteristics of over 500 star-forming clumps in the tails and find median values of H $\alpha$ luminosity LH $\alpha$ = 4 × 1038 erg s−1, dust extinction AV = 0.5 mag, star formation rate SFR= 0.003 M yr−1, ionized gas density ne = 52 cm−3, ionized gas mass Mgas = 4 × 104 M, and stellar mass M∗ = 3 × 106 M. The tail clumps follow scaling relations (Mgas − M∗, LH $\alpha$ − $\sigma$, SFR-Mgas) similar to disc clumps, and their stellar masses are comparable to Ultra Compact Dwarfs and Globular Clusters. The diffuse gas component in the tails is ionized by a combination of SF and composite/LINER-like emission likely due to thermal conduction or turbulence. The stellar photoionization component of the diffuse gas can be due either to leakage of ionizing photons from the H II clumps with an average escape fraction of 18 per cent, or lower luminosity H II regions that we cannot individually identify.},

abstract = {We present the results of high-resolution AP3M+SPH simulations of merging clusters of galaxies. We find that the compression and shocking of the core gas during a merger can lead to large increases in bolometric X-ray luminosities and emission-weighted temperatures of clusters. Cooling flows are completely disrupted during equal-mass mergers, with the mass deposition rate dropping to zero as the cores of the clusters collide. The large increase in the cooling time of the core gas strongly suggests that cooling flows will not recover from such a merger within a Hubble time. Mergers with subclumps having one eighth of the mass of the main cluster are also found to disrupt a cooling flow if the merger is head-on. However, in this case the entropy injected into the core gas is rapidly radiated away and the cooling flow restarts within a few Gyr of the merger. Mergers in which the subcluster has an impact parameter of 500 kpc do not disrupt the cooling flow, although the mass deposition rate is reduced by ∼30 per cent. Finally, we find that equal mass, off-centre mergers can effectively mix gas in the cores of clusters, while head on mergers lead to very little mixing. Gas stripped from the outer layers of subclumps results in parts of the outer layers of the main cluster being well mixed, although they have little effect on the gas in the core of the cluster. None of the mergers examined here resulted in the intracluster medium being well mixed globally.},

We carried out a search for signatures of past interactions connected to the putative hosts of NGC 1052-DF2 and NGC 1052-DF4 using a very deep L-band image obtained with the 0.7 m Jeanne Rich telescope that reach a surface brightness limit of 28.5 mag arcsec-2 in the r band. We found several low-surface brightness features, possibly consistent with an ongoing merger history in this group. We find a tidal interaction between NGC 1052 and NGC 1047, confirming a physical association. Furthermore, we find a stellar loop around NGC 1052 in the direction of NGC 1042 and a stellar stream pointing in the direction of NGC 1052-DF2, but they are not directly connected. We find no evidence for a recent tidal interaction for NGC 1052-DF2 and NGC 1052-DF4. No LSB features have been uncovered around the spiral galaxy NGC 1042, which leaves the association (physical or projected) between NGC 1052 and NGC 1042 ambiguous, although they have similar radial velocities. Their association will only be established when accurate distances to both objects have been measured.},

abstract = {We study the evolution of dwarf (LH{\textless} 109.6LH⊙) star-forming and quiescent galaxies in the Virgo Cluster by comparing their UV to radio centimetric properties to the predictions of multizone chemospectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution especially tuned to take into account the perturbations induced by the interaction with the cluster intergalactic medium. Our models simulate one or multiple ram pressure stripping events and galaxy starvation. Models predict that all star-forming dwarf galaxies entering the cluster for the first time loose most, if not all, of their atomic gas content, quenching on short timescales ({\textless} 150 Myr) their activity of star formation. These dwarf galaxies soon become red and quiescent, gas metal-rich objects with spectrophotometric and structural properties similar to those of dwarf ellipticals. Young, low-luminosity, high surface brightness star-forming galaxies such as late-type spirals and BCDs are probably the progenitors of relatively massive dwarf ellipticals, while it is likely that low surface brightness Magellanic irregulars evolve into very low surface brightness quiescent objects hardly detectable in ground-based imaging surveys. The small number of dwarf galaxies with physical properties intermediate between those of star-forming and quiescent systems is consistent with a rapid ({\textless}1 Gyr) transitional phase between the two dwarf galaxy populations. These results, combined with statistical considerations, are consistent with the idea that most of the dwarf ellipticals dominating the faint end of the Virgo luminosity function were initially star-forming systems, accreted by the cluster and stripped of their gas by one or subsequent ram pressure stripping events. {\textcopyright} 2008.

They avoid the central, virialised region of the cluster both on the sky and in projected phase-space, showing that they are recent arrivals and that, in Fornax, HI is lost within a crossing time, {\~{}}2 Gyr. Half of these galaxies exhibit a disturbed HI morphology, including several cases of asymmetries, tails, offsets between HI and optical centres, and a case of a truncated HI disc suggesting that they have been interacting within or on their way to Fornax. Our HI detections are HI-poorer and form stars at a lower rate than non-cluster galaxies in the same {\$}M{\_}\backslashstar{\$} range. Low mass galaxies are more strongly affected throughout their infall towards the cluster. The MHI/{\$}M{\_}\backslashstar{\$} ratio of Fornax galaxies is comparable to that in the Virgo cluster. At fixed {\$}M{\_}\backslashstar{\$}, our HI detections follow the non-cluster relation between MHI and the star formation rate, and we argue that this implies that so far they have lost their HI on a timescale {\$}\backslashgtrsim{\$}1-2 Gyr. Deeper inside the cluster HI removal is likely to proceed faster, as confirmed by a population of HI-undetected but H{\$}{\_}2{\$}-detected star-forming galaxies. Based on ALMA data, we find a large scatter in H{\$}{\_}2{\$}-to-HI mass ratio, with several galaxies showing an unusually high ratio that is probably caused by faster HI removal.

abstract = {We present the highest-resolution study to date of the interstellar medium (ISM) in galaxies undergoing ram pressure stripping, using Hubble Space Telescope BVI imaging of NGC 4522 and NGC 4402, Virgo Cluster spirals that are well known to be experiencing intracluster medium (ICM) ram pressure. We find that throughout most of both galaxies, the main dust lane has a fairly well-defined edge, with a population of giant molecular cloud (GMC) sized (tens- to hundreds-of-pc scale), isolated, highly extincting dust clouds located up to 1.5 kpc radially beyond it. Outside of these dense clouds, the area has little or no diffuse dust extinction, indicating that the clouds have decoupled from the lower-density ISM material that has already been stripped. Several of the dust clouds have elongated morphologies that indicate active ram pressure, including two large (kpc scale) filaments in NGC 4402 that are elongated in the projected ICM wind direction. We calculate a lower limit on the H I + H2 masses of these clouds based on their dust extinctions and find that a correction factor of 10 gives cloud masses consistent with those measured in CO for clouds of similar diameters, probably due to the complicating factors of foreground light, cloud substructure, and resolution limitations. Assuming that the clouds' actual masses are consistent with those of GMCs of similar diameters (10 4-105 M ), we estimate that only a small fraction (1{\%}-10{\%}) of the original H I + H2 remains in the parts of the disks with decoupled clouds. Based on H$\alpha$ images, a similar fraction of star formation persists in these regions, 2{\%}-3{\%} of the estimated pre-stripping star formation rate. We find that the decoupled cloud lifetimes may be up to 150-200 Myr. {\textcopyright} 2014. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..},

The smooth, well-posed initial conditions of Lecoanet et al. (2016) are used, along with an explicit Navier-Stokes viscosity and thermal conductivity to enforce the evolution in the non-linear regime. We demonstrate convergence to the reference solution using SPH. The evolution of the vortex structures and the degree of mixing, as measured by a passive scalar 'colour' field, match the reference solution. Tests with an initial density contrast produce the correct qualitative behaviour. The L2 error of the SPH calculations decreases as the resolution is increased. The primary source of error is numerical dissipation arising from artificial viscosity, and tests with reduced artificial viscosity have reduced L2 error. A high-order smoothing kernel is needed in order to resolve the initial velocity amplitude of the seeded mode and inhibit excitation of spurious modes. We find that standard SPH with an artificial viscosity has no difficulty in correctly modelling the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and yields convergent solutions.},

abstract = {By implementing a dynamic wind-tunnel model in a smoothed-particle chemodynamic/hydrodynamic simulation suite, we have investigated the effects of ram pressure and tidal forces on dwarf galaxies similar to the Magellanic Clouds, within host galaxies with gas and dark matter halos that are varied, to compare the relative effects of tides and ram pressure. We concentrate on how the distributions of metals are affected by interactions. We find that while ram pressure and tidal forces have some effect on dwarf galaxy outflows, these effects do not produce large differences in the metal distributions of the dwarf disks other than truncation in the outer regions in some cases, and that confinement from the host galaxy gas halo appears to be more significant than ram pressure stripping. We find that stochastic variations in the star formation rate can explain the remaining variations in disk metal properties. This raises questions on the cause of low metallicities in dwarf galaxies.},

abstract = {We present a suite of three-dimensional, high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations that follow the evolution of a massive (107 M⊙) pressure-confined, star-forming neutral gas cloud moving through a hot intracluster medium (ICM). The main goal of the analysis is to get theoretical insight into the lifetimes and evolution of stellar systems like the recently discovered star-forming cloud SECCO 1 in the Virgo cluster of galaxies, but it may be of general interest for the study of the star-forming gas clumps that are observed in the tails of ram pressure stripped galaxies. Building up on a previous, simple simulation, we explored the effect of different relative velocity of the cloud and larger temperature of the ICM, as well as the effect of the cloud self-gravity. Moreover, we performed a simulation including star formation and stellar feedback, allowing for a first time a direct comparison with the observed properties of the stars in the system. The survivability of the cold gas in the simulated clouds is granted on time-scales of the order of 1 Gyr, with final cold gas fractions generally {\textgreater}0.75. In all cases, the simulated systems end up, after 1 Gyr of evolution, as symmetric clouds in pressure equilibrium with the external hot gas. We also confirm that gravity played a negligible role at the largest scales on the evolution of the clouds. In our simulation with star formation, star formation begins immediately, it peaks at the earliest times, and decreases monotonically with time. Inhomogeneous supernova explosions are the cause of an asymmetric shape of the gas cloud, facilitating the development of instabilities and the decrease of the cold gas fraction.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate whether Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), equipped with artificial conductivity, is able to capture the physics of density/energy discontinuities in the case of the so-called shearing layers test, a test for examining Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instabilities. We can trace back each failure of SPH to show KH rolls to two causes: i) shock waves travelling in the simulation box and ii) particle clumping, or more generally, particle noise. The probable cause of shock waves is the Local Mixing Instability (LMI), previously identified in the literature. Particle noise on the other hand is a problem because it introduces a large error in the SPH momentum equation. We also investigate the role of artificial conductivity (AC). Including AC is necessary for the long-term behavior of the simulation (e.g. to get {\$}\backslashlambda=1/2, 1{\$} KH rolls). In sensitive hydrodynamical simulations great care is however needed in selecting the AC signal velocity, with the default formulation leading to too much energy diffusion. We present new signal velocities that lead to less diffusion. The effects of the shock waves and of particle disorder become less important as the time-scale of the physical problem (for the shearing layers problem: lower density contrast and higher Mach numbers) decreases. At the resolution of current galaxy formation simulations mixing is probably not important. However, mixing could become crucial for next-generation simulations.},

abstract = {The Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation (BTFR) is an empirical relation between baryonic mass and rotation velocity in disk galaxies. It provides tests of galaxy formation models in LCDM and of alternative theories like MOND. Observations of gas rich galaxies provide a measure of the slope and normalization of the BTFR that is more accurate (if less precise) than that provided by star dominated spirals, as their masses are insensitive to the details of stellar population modeling. Recent independent data for such galaxies are consistent with Mb = AVf{\^{}}4 with A = 47+/-6 Msun (km/s){\^{}}-4. This is equivalent to MOND with {\$}a{\_}0 = 1.3 +/- 0.3 A/s/s. The scatter in the data is consistent with being due entirely to observational uncertainties. It is unclear why the physics of galaxy formation in LCDM happens to pick out the relation predicted by MOND. We introduce a feedback efficacy parameter E to relate halo properties to those of the galaxies they host. E correlates with star formation rate and gas fraction in the sense that galaxies that have experienced the least star formation have been most impacted by feedback.},

abstract = {We study the convergence properties of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) using numerical tests and simple analytic considerations. Our analysis shows that formal numerical convergence is possible in SPH only in the joint limit {\$}N \backslashrightarrow \backslashinfty{\$}, {\$}h \backslashrightarrow 0{\$}, and {\$}N{\_}{\{}nb{\}} \backslashrightarrow \backslashinfty{\$}, where {\$}N{\$} is the total number of particles, {\$}h{\$} is the smoothing length, and {\$}N{\_}{\{}nb{\}}{\$} is the number of neighbor particles within the smoothing volume used to compute smoothed estimates. Previous work has generally assumed that the conditions {\$}N \backslashrightarrow \backslashinfty{\$} and {\$}h \backslashrightarrow 0{\$} are sufficient to achieve convergence, while holding {\$}N{\_}{\{}nb{\}}{\$} fixed. We demonstrate that if {\$}N{\_}{\{}nb{\}}{\$} is held fixed as the resolution is increased, there will be a residual source of error that does not vanish as {\$}N \backslashrightarrow \backslashinfty{\$} and {\$}h \backslashrightarrow 0{\$}. Formal numerical convergence in SPH is possible only if {\$}N{\_}{\{}nb{\}}{\$} is increased systematically as the resolution is improved. Using analytic arguments, we derive an optimal compromise scaling for {\$}N{\_}{\{}nb{\}}{\$} by requiring that this source of error balance that present in the smoothing procedure. For typical choices of the smoothing kernel, we find {\$}N{\_}{\{}nb{\}} \backslashpropto N{\^{}}{\{}1/2{\}}{\$}. This means that if SPH is to be used as a numerically convergent method, the required computational cost does not scale with particle number as {\$}O(N){\$}, but rather as {\$}O(N{\^{}}{\{}1+\backslashdelta{\}}){\$}, where {\$}\backslashdelta \backslashapprox 1/2{\$}, with a weak dependence on the form of the smoothing kernel.},

abstract = {We propose and successfully test against new cosmological simulations a novel analytical description of the physical processes associated with the origin of cored dark matter density profiles. In the simulations, the potential in the central kiloparsec changes on sub-dynamical timescales over the redshift interval 4 {\textgreater} z {\textgreater} 2 as repeated, energetic feedback generates large underdense bubbles of expanding gas from centrally-concentrated bursts of star formation. The model demonstrates how fluctuations in the central potential irreversibly transfer energy into collisionless particles, thus generating a dark matter core. A supply of gas undergoing collapse and rapid expansion is therefore the essential ingredient. The framework, based on a novel impulsive approximation, breaks with the reliance on adiabatic approximations which are inappropriate in the rapidly-changing limit. It shows that both outflows and galactic fountains can give rise to cusp-flattening, even when only a few per cent of the baryons form stars. Dwarf galaxies maintain their core to the present time. The model suggests that constant density dark matter cores will be generated in systems of a wide mass range if central starbursts or AGN phases are sufficiently frequent and energetic.},

Etna (Italy), and a mini-array composed of nine ASTRI telescopes, proposed to be installed at the southern CTA site. The ASTRI mini-array is a collaborative effort led by INAF and carried out by institutes from Italy, Brazil, and South-Africa. The project is also including the full data handling chain from raw data up to final scientific products. To this end, a dedicated software for the online/ on-site/off-site data reconstruction and scientific analysis is under development for both the ASTRI SST-2M prototype and mini-array. The software is designed following a modular approach in which each single component and the entire pipeline are developed in compliance with the CTA requirements. Data reduction is conceived to be run on parallel computing architectures, as multi-core CPUs and graphic accelerators (GPUs), and new hardware architectures based on low-power consumption processors (e.g. ARM). The software components are coded in C++/Python/CUDA and wrapped by efficient pipelines written in Python. The final scientific products are then achieved by means of either science tools currently being used in the CTA Consortium (e.g. Ctools) or specifically developed ones. In this contribution, we present the framework and the main software components of the ASTRI SST-2M prototype and mini-array data reconstruction and scientific analysis software package, and report the status of its development.},

These simulations follow the non-linear evolution of galaxies modeling a variety of physical processes over an enormous range of scales. A better understanding of the physics relevant for shaping galaxies, improved numerical methods, and increased computing power have led to simulations that can reproduce a large number of observed galaxy properties. Modern simulations model dark matter, dark energy, and ordinary matter in an expanding space-time starting from well-defined initial conditions. The modeling of ordinary matter is most challenging due to the large array of physical processes affecting this matter component. Cosmological simulations have also proven useful to study alternative cosmological models and their impact on the galaxy population.

abstract = {Ram-pressure stripping (RPS) is a well observed phenomenon of massive spiral galaxies passing through the hot intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters. For dwarf galaxies (DGs) within a cluster, the transformation from gaseous to gas-poor systems by RPS is not easily observed and must happen in the outskirts of clusters. In a few objects in close by galaxy clusters and the field, RPS has been observed. Since cluster early-type DGs also show a large variety of internal structures (unexpected central gas reservoirs, blue stellar cores, composite radial stellar profiles), we aim in this study to investigate how ram pressure (RP) affects the interstellar gas content and therefore the star formation (SF) activity. Using a series of numerical simulations, we quantify the dependence of the stripped-off gas on the velocity of the infalling DGs and on the ambient ICM density. We demonstrated that SF can be either suppressed or triggered by RP depending on the ICM density and the DGs mass. Under some conditions, RP can compress the gas, so that it is unexpectedly retained in the central DG region and forms stars. When gas clouds are still bound against stripping but lifted from a thin disc and fall back, their new stars form an ellipsoidal (young) stellar population already with a larger velocity dispersion without the necessity of harassment. Most spectacularly, star clusters can form downstream in stripped-off massive gas clouds in the case of strong RP. We compare our results to observations.},

abstract = {Voronoi diagrams appear in many areas in science and technology and have numerous applications. They have been the subject of extensive investigation during the last decades. Roughly speaking, they are a certain decomposition of a given space into cells, induced by a distance function and by a tuple of subsets called the generators or the sites. Consider the following question: does a small change of the sites, e.g., of their position or shape, yield a small change in the corresponding Voronoi cells? This question is by all means natural and fundamental, since in practice one approximates the sites either because of inexact information about them, because of inevitable numerical errors in their representation, for simplification purposes and so on, and it is important to know whether the resulting Voronoi cells approximate the real ones well. The traditional approach to Voronoi diagrams, and, in particular, to (variants of) this question, is combinatorial. However, it seems that there has been a very limited discussion in the geometric sense (the shape of the cells), mainly an intuitive one, without proofs, in Euclidean spaces. We formalize this question precisely, and then show that the answer is positive in the case of R{\^{}}d, or, more generally, in (possibly infinite dimensional) uniformly convex normed spaces, assuming there is a common positive lower bound on the distance between the sites. Explicit bounds are given, and we allow infinitely many sites of a general form. The relevance of this result is illustrated using several pictures and many real-world and theoretical examples and counterexamples.},

abstract = {Recent high-resolution simulations that include Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and baryons have shown that baryonic physics can dramatically alter the dark matter structure of galaxies. These results modify our predictions for observed galaxy evolution and structure. Given these updated expectations, it is timely to re-examine observational constraints on the dark matter model. A few observations are reviewed that may indirectly trace dark matter, and may help confirm or deny possible dark matter models. Warm Dark Matter (WDM) and Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) are currently the favorite alternative models to CDM. Constraints on the WDM particle mass require it to be so heavy that WDM is nearly indistinguishable from CDM. The best observational test of SIDM is likely to be in the dark matter distribution of faint dwarf galaxies, but there is a lack of theoretical predictions for galaxy structure in SIDM that account for the role of baryons.},

abstract = {Galactic scaling relations between the (surface densities of) the gas mass and the star formation (SF) rate are known to develop substantial scatter or even change form when considered belowa certain spatial scale.We quantify how this behaviour should be expected due to the incomplete statistical sampling of independent star-forming regions. Other included limiting factors are the incomplete sampling of SF tracers from the stellar initial mass function and the spatial drift between gas and stars. We present a simple uncertainty principle for SF, which can be used to predict and interpret the failure of galactic SF relations on small spatial scales. This uncertainty principle explains how the scatter of SF relations depends on the spatial scale and predicts a scale-dependent bias of the gas depletion time-scale when centring an aperture on gas or SF tracer peaks.We show how the scatter and bias are sensitive to the physical size and time-scales involved in the SF process (such as its duration or the molecular cloud lifetime), and illustrate how our formalism provides a powerful tool to constrain these largely unknown quantities. Thanks to its general form, the uncertainty principle can also be applied to other astrophysical systems, e.g. addressing the time evolution of star-forming cores, protoplanetary discs or galaxies and their nuclei. {\textcopyright} 2014 The AuthorsPublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect offers a means of probing the hot gas in and around massive galaxies and galaxy groups and clusters, which is thought to constitute a large fraction of the baryon content of the Universe. The Planck collaboration recently performed a stacking analysis of a large sample of `locally brightest galaxies' (LBGs) and, surprisingly, inferred an approximately self-similar relation between the tSZ flux and halo mass. At face value, this implies that the hot gas mass fraction is independent of halo mass, a result which is in apparent conflict with resolved X-ray observations. We test the robustness of the inferred trend using synthetic tSZ maps generated from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and using the same tools and assumptions applied in the Planck study. We show that, while the detection and the estimate of the `total' flux (within {\$}5 r{\_}{\{}500{\}}{\$}) is reasonably robust, the inferred flux originating from within {\$}r{\_}{\{}500{\}}{\$} (i.e. the limiting radius to which X-ray observations typically probe) is highly sensitive to the assumed pressure distribution of the gas. Using our most realistic simulations with AGN feedback, that reproduce a wide variety of X-ray and optical properties of groups and clusters, we estimate that the derived tSZ flux within {\$}r{\_}{\{}500{\}}{\$} is biased high by up to to an order of magnitude for haloes with masses {\$}M{\_}{\{}500{\}} \backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}13{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}. Moreover, we show that the AGN simulations are consistent with the total tSZ flux-mass relation observed with Planck, whereas a self-similar model is ruled out.},

abstract = {Using N-body simulations we study the formation and evolution of tidally induced bars in disky galaxies in clusters. Our progenitor is a massive, late-type galaxy similar to the Milky Way, composed of an exponential disk and an NFW dark matter halo. We place the galaxy on four different orbits in a Virgo-like cluster and evolve it for 10 Gyr. As a reference case we also evolve the same model in isolation. Tidally induced bars form on all orbits soon after the first pericenter passage and survive until the end of the evolution. They appear earlier, are stronger, longer and have lower pattern speeds for tighter orbits. Only for the tightest orbit the properties of the bar are controlled by the orientation of the tidal torque from the cluster at pericenters. The mechanism behind the formation of the bars is the angular momentum transfer from the galaxy stellar component to its halo. All bars undergo extended periods of buckling instability that occur earlier and lead to more pronounced boxy/peanut shapes when the tidal forces are stronger. Using all simulation outputs of galaxies at different evolutionary stages we construct a toy model of the galaxy population in the cluster and measure the average bar strength and bar fraction as a function of clustercentric radius. Both are found to be mildly decreasing functions of radius. We conclude that tidal forces can trigger bar formation in cluster cores, but not in the outskirts, and thus cause larger concentrations of barred galaxies towards cluster center.},

abstract = {We present the stellar and gas kinematics of DDO 46 and DDO 168 from the LITTLE THINGS survey and determine their respective Vmax/sigma{\_}z,0 values. We used the KPNO's 4-meter telescope with the Echelle spectrograph as a long-slit spectrograph. We acquired spectra of DDO 168 along four position angles by placing the slit over the morphological major and minor axes and two intermediate position angles. However, due to poor weather conditions during our observing run for DDO 46, we were able to extract only one useful data point from the morphological major axis. We determined a central stellar velocity dispersion perpendicular to the disk, sigma{\_}z,0, of 13.5+/-8 km/s for DDO 46 and {\textless}sigma{\_}z,0{\textgreater} of 10.7+/-2.9 km/s for DDO 168. We then derived the maximum rotation speed in both galaxies using the LITTLE THINGS HI data. We separated bulk motions from non-circular motions using a double Gaussian decomposition technique and applied a tilted-ring model to the bulk velocity field. We corrected the observed HI rotation speeds for asymmetric drift and found a maximum velocity, Vmax, of 77.4 +/- 3.7 and 67.4 +/- 4.0 km/s for DDO 46 and DDO 168, respectively. Thus, we derived a kinematic measure, Vmax/sigma{\_}z,0, of 5.7 +/- 0.6 for DDO 46 and 6.3 +/- 0.3 for DDO 168. Comparing these values to ones determined for spiral galaxies, we find that DDO 46 and DDO 168 have Vmax/sigma{\_}z,0 values indicative of thin disks, which is in contrast to minor-to-major axis ratio studies.},

abstract = {The Local Group galaxies offer some of the most discriminating tests of models of cosmic structure formation. For example, observations of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda satellite populations appear to be in disagreement with N-body simulations of the 'lambda cold dark matter' ($\Lambda$CDM) model: There are far fewer satellite galaxies than substructures in CDM haloes (the 'missing satellites' problem); dwarf galaxies seem to avoid the most massive substructures (the 'too-big-to-fail' problem); and the brightest satellites appear to orbit their host galaxies on a thin plane (the 'planes of satellites' problem). Here we present results from APOSTLE (A Project Of Simulating The Local Environment), a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of 12 volumes selected to match the kinematics of the Local Group (LG) members. Applying the EAGLE code to the LG environment, we find that our simulations match the observed abundance of LG galaxies, including the satellite galaxies of the MW and Andromeda. Due to changes to the structure of haloes and the evolution in the LG environment, the simulations reproduce the observed relation between stellar mass and velocity dispersion of individual dwarf spheroidal galaxies without necessitating the formation of cores in their dark matter profiles. Satellite systems form with a range of spatial anisotropies, including one similar to the MWs, confirming that such a configuration is not unexpected in $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, based on the observed velocity dispersion, size, and stellar mass, we provide estimates of the maximum circular velocity for the haloes of nine MW dwarf spheroidals.},

The evolution trends in baryonic and dark matter are similar, while moderate differences are observed. Sheets appeared early and their large scale pattern may have been set up by {\$}z=3{\$}. In term of mass, filaments superseded sheets as the primary collapsing structures at {\$}z\backslashsim2-3{\$}. Tenuous filaments assembled with each other to form prominent ones at {\$}z{\textless}{\~{}}2{\$}. In accordance with the construction of the frame of sheets, the cosmic divergence velocity, {\$}v{\_}{\{}div{\}}{\$}, had been well developed above 2-3 Mpc by z=3. Afterwards, curl velocity, {\$}v{\_}{\{}curl{\}}{\$}, grown dramatically along with the rising of filaments, become comparable to {\$}v{\_}{\{}div{\}}{\$}, for {\$}{\textless}2-3 Mpc{\$} at {\$}z=0{\$}.

Compared with dark matter, mildly less baryonic matter is found residing in filaments and clusters, and its vorticity has been developed more significantly below {\$}2-3 Mpc{\$}. These differences may be underestimated due to the limited resolution and lack of star formation in our simulation.

If these ordinates are the values of a known analytic function F(x), then the problem of interpolation between these ordinates has an obvious and precise meaning: we are required to compute intermediate values F(x) to the same accuracy to which the ordinates are known. Undoubtedly, the most convenient tool for the solution of this problem is the polynomial central interpolation method. It uses the polynomial of degree k — 1, interpolating k successive ordinates, as an approximation to F(x) only within a unit interval in x, centrally located with respect to its k defining ordinates. Assuming k fixed, successive approximating arcs for F(x) are thus obtained which present discontinuities on passing from one arc to the next if k is odd, or discontinuities in their first derivatives if k is even (see section 2.121). Actually these discontinuities are irrelevant in our present case of an analytic function F(x). Indeed, if the interpolated values obtained are sufficiently accurate, these discontinuities will be apparent only if we force the computation beyond the intrinsic accuracy of the y n.},

We identify four sloshing cold fronts in the intracluster medium, residing at radii of 3$\backslash$,kpc (west), 10$\backslash$,kpc (northeast), 30$\backslash$,kpc (southwest) and 200$\backslash$,kpc (east). Despite spanning over two orders of magnitude in radius, all four cold fronts fall onto the same spiral pattern that wraps around the BCG NGC{\~{}}1399, likely all initiated by the infall of NGC{\~{}}1404. The most evident front is to the northeast, 10$\backslash$,kpc from the cluster center, which separates low-entropy high-metallicity gas and high-entropy low-metallicity gas. The metallicity map suggests that gas sloshing, rather than an AGN outburst, is the driving force behind the redistribution of the enriched gas in this cluster. The innermost cold front resides within the radius of the strong cool core. The sloshing time scale within the cooling radius, calculated from the Brunt-V{\$}\backslashddot{\{}\backslashrm a{\}}{\$}s{\$}\backslashddot{\{}\backslashrm a{\}}{\$}l{\$}\backslashddot{\{}\backslashrm a{\}}{\$} frequency, is an order of magnitude shorter than the cooling time.

We confirm the results of previous authors showing that galaxies tend to follow a typical path in phase-space as they settle into the cluster potential. As such, different regions of phase-space can be associated with different times since first infalling into the cluster. However, in addition, we see a clear trend between total mass loss due to cluster tides, and time since infall. Thus we find location in phase-space provides information on both infall time, and tidal mass loss. We find the predictive power of phase-space diagrams remains even when projected quantities are used (i.e. line-of-sight velocities, and projected distances from the cluster). We provide figures that can be directly compared with observed samples of cluster galaxies and we also provide the data used to make them as supplementary data, in order to encourage the use of phase-space diagrams as a tool to understand cluster environmental effects. We find that our results depend very weakly on galaxy mass or host mass, so the predictions in our phase-space diagrams can be applied to groups or clusters alike, or to galaxy populations from dwarfs up to giants.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the properties of Hi holes detected in 20 galaxies that are part of "The Hi Nearby Galaxy Survey." We detected more than 1000 holes in total in the sampled galaxies. Where they can be measured, their sizes range from about 100 pc (our resolution limit) to about 2 kpc, their expansion velocities range from 4 to 36 km s-1, and their ages are estimated to range between 3 and 150 Myr. The holes are found throughout the disks of the galaxies, out to the edge of the Hi disk; 23{\%} of the holes fall outside R25. We find that shear limits the age of holes in spirals (shear is less important in dwarf galaxies) which explains why Hi holes in dwarfs are rounder, on average than in spirals. Shear, which is particularly strong in the inner part of spiral galaxies, also explains why we find that holes outside R25 are larger and older. We derive the scale height of the Hi disk as a function of galactocentric radius and find that the disk flares up in all galaxies. We proceed to derive the surface and volume porosity (Q2D and Q3D) and find that this correlates with the type of the host galaxy: later Hubble types tend to be more porous. The size distribution of the holes in our sample follows a power law with a slope of a?∼ -2.9. Assuming that the holes are the result of massive star formation (SF), we derive values for the supernova rate and star formation rate (SFR) which scales with the SFR derived based on other tracers. If we extrapolate the observed number of holes to include those that fall below our resolution limit, down to holes created by a single supernova, we find that our results are compatible with the hypothesis that Hi holes result from SF. {\textcopyright} 2011.

This intermediate massive cluster ($\sigma$ = 550 km s-1) is surrounded by a complex large-scale structure.

Approximately 50 per cent of the UDGs analysed in the selected area inhabit the cluster region ({\~{}}11 ± 5 per cent in the core and {\~{}}39 ± 9 per cent in the outskirts), whereas the remaining UDGs are found outside the main cluster structure ({\~{}}50 ± 11 per cent).

abstract = {Several manifold learning techniques have been developed to learn, given a data, a single lower dimensional manifold providing a compact representation of the original data. However, for complex data sets containing multiple manifolds of possibly of different dimensionalities, it is unlikely that the existing manifold learning approaches can discover all the interesting lower-dimensional structures. We therefore introduce a hierarchical manifolds learning framework to discover a variety of the underlying low dimensional structures. The framework is based on hierarchical mixture latent variable model, in which each submodel is a latent variable model capturing a single manifold. We propose a novel multiple manifold approximation strategy used for the initialization of our hierarchical model. The technique is first verified on artificial data with mixed 1 −, 2 − and 3 −dimensional structures. It is then used to automatically detect lower-dimensional structures in disrupted satellite galaxies.},

abstract = {The Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) paradigm makes specific predictions for the abundance, structure, substructure and clustering of dark matter halos, the sites of galaxy formation. These predictions can be directly tested, in the low-mass halo regime, by dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxies. A number of potential challenges to LCDM have been identified when confronting the expected properties of dwarfs with observation. I review our understanding of a few of these issues, including the `missing satellites' and the `too-big-to-fail' problems, and argue that neither poses an insurmountable challenge to LCDM. Solving these problems requires that most dwarf galaxies inhabit halos of similar mass, and that there is a relatively sharp minimum halo mass threshold to form luminous galaxies. These predictions are eminently falsifiable. In particular, LCDM predicts a large number of `dark' low-mass halos, some of which sould have retained enough primordial gas to be detectable in deep 21 cm or H{\$}{\_}\backslashalpha{\$} surveys. Detecting this predicted population of `mini-halos' would be a major discovery and a resounding success for LCDM on small scales.},

abstract = {We present an improved analytic calculation for the tidal radius of satellites and test our results against N-body simulations. The tidal radius in general depends upon four factors: the potential of the host galaxy, the potential of the satellite, the orbit of the satellite and {\{}$\backslash$it the orbit of the star within the satellite{\}}. We demonstrate that this last point is critical and suggest using {\{}$\backslash$it three tidal radii{\}} to cover the range of orbits of stars within the satellite. In this way we show explicitly that prograde star orbits will be more easily stripped than radial orbits; while radial orbits are more easily stripped than retrograde ones. This result has previously been established by several authors numerically, but can now be understood analytically. For point mass, power-law (which includes the isothermal sphere), and a restricted class of split power law potentials our solution is fully analytic. For more general potentials, we provide an equation which may be rapidly solved numerically. Over short times ({\$}\backslashsimlt 1-2{\$} Gyrs {\$}\backslashsim 1{\$} satellite orbit), we find excellent agreement between our analytic and numerical models. Over longer times, star orbits within the satellite are transformed by the tidal field of the host galaxy. In a Hubble time, this causes a convergence of the three limiting tidal radii towards the prograde stripping radius. Beyond the prograde stripping radius, the velocity dispersion will be tangentially anisotropic.},

abstract = {Various formulations of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) have been proposed, intended to resolve certain difficulties in the treatment of fluid mixing instabilities. Most have involved changes to the algorithm which either introduces artificial correction terms or violates what is arguably the greatest advantage of SPH over other methods: manifest conservation of energy, entropy, momentum and angular momentum. Here, we show how a class of alternative SPH equations of motion (EOM) can be derived self-consistently from a discrete particle Lagrangian – guaranteeing manifest conservation – in a manner which tremendously improves treatment of these instabilities and contact discontinuities. Saitoh {\&} Makino recently noted that the volume element used to discretize the EOM does not need to explicitly invoke the mass density (as in the ‘standard' approach); we show how this insight, and the resulting degree of freedom, can be incorporated into the rigorous Lagrangian formulation that retains ideal conservation properties and includes the ‘∇h' terms that account for variable smoothing lengths. We derive a general EOM for any choice of volume element (particle ‘weights') and method of determining smoothing lengths. We then specify this to a ‘pressure–entropy formulation' which resolves problems in the traditional treatment of fluid interfaces. Implementing this in a new version of the GADGET code, we show it leads to good performance in mixing experiments (e.g. Kelvin–Helmholtz and ‘blob' tests). And conservation is maintained even in strong shock/blastwave tests, where formulations without manifest conservation produce large errors. This also improves the treatment of subsonic turbulence and lessens the need for large kernel particle numbers. The code changes are trivial and entail no additional numerical expense. This provides a general framework for self-consistent derivation of different ‘flavours' of SPH.},

The resulting sample, the most comprehensive to date, is used to investigate the distribution of neutral hydrogen in the cluster galaxies. We compare the Hi content of the detected cluster galaxies with that of field galaxies by measuring Hi mass-to-light ratios and the Hi deficiency parameter of Solanes et al. ([CITE]). The mean Hi mass-to-light ratio of the cluster galaxies is , significantly lower than for a sample of Hi-selected field galaxies (), although not as low as in the Virgo cluster (). In addition, the Hi content of two cluster galaxies (NGC 1316C and NGC 1326B) appears to have been affected by interactions. The mean Hi deficiency for the cluster is (for galaxy types ), significantly greater than for the field sample (). Both these tests show that Fornax cluster galaxies are Hi-deficient compared to field galaxies. The kinematics of the cluster galaxies suggests that the Hi deficiency may be caused by ram-pressure stripping of galaxies on orbits that pass close to the cluster core. We also derive the most complete B-band Tully -Fisher relation of inclined spiral galaxies in Fornax. A subcluster in the South-West of the main cluster contributes considerably to the scatter. The scatter for galaxies in the main cluster alone is 0.50 mag, which is slightly larger than the intrinsic scatter of 0.4 mag. We use the Tully -Fisher relation to derive a distance modulus of Fornax relative to the Virgo cluster of mag. The galaxies in the subcluster are () mag brighter than the galaxies of the main cluster, indicating that they are situated in the foreground. With their mean velocity 95 km s-1 higher than that of the main cluster we conclude that the subcluster is falling into the main Fornax cluster.},

We confirm the existence of a tight relation between colour and H i fraction across all the range of colours, although outside the blue cloud this trend becomes gradually weaker. Transition galaxies are divided into two different families, according to their atomic hydrogen content. 'H i-deficient' galaxies are the majority of transition galaxies in our sample. They are found in high-density environments and all their properties are consistent with a quenching of the star formation via gas stripping. However, while the migration from the blue cloud is relatively quick (i.e. ≲1 Gyr), a longer amount of time (a few Gyr at least) seems required to completely suppress the star formation and reach the red sequence. At all masses, migrating 'H i-deficient' galaxies are mainly discs, implying that the mechanism responsible for today's migration in clusters cannot have played a significant role in the creation of the red sequence at high redshift. Conversely, 'H i-normal' transition galaxies are a more heterogeneous population. A significant fraction of these objects show star formation in ring-like structures and evidence for accretion/minor-merging events suggesting that at least part of the H i reservoir has an external origin. The detailed evolution of such systems is still unclear, but our analysis suggests that, in at least two cases, galaxies might have migrated back from the red sequence after accretion events. Interestingly, the H i available may be sufficient to sustain star formation at the current rate for several billion years. Our study clearly shows the variety of evolutionary paths leading to the transition region and suggests that the transition galaxies may not be always associated with systems quickly migrating from the blue to the red sequence. {\textcopyright} 2009 RAS.},

abstract = {A new method for 2-dimensional simulations of galaxy encounters is introduced. The simulation system consists of two planar particle disks embedded in rigid spherical halos. In addition to stellar component reacting solely to gravitational forces, gaseous component is included by allowing for dissipative impacts between some of the particles. The new feature of the model is in the calculation of the gravitational potential: this is performed simultaneously in two moving, mutually overlapping logarithmic polar coordinate systems, attached to the centers of each halo. Polar coordinates are used only for potential calculations, the integrations for particles as well as for halo centers being carried out in an inertial rectangular system. The advantage of this method lies on the fact that due to the use of two polar coordinate systems the resolution of the potential calculation is always greatest in the regions where particle density is highest, whereas integrations can be performed by using simple and fast cartesian leapfrog methods. Also, when using a logarithmic grid, it is very easy to cover a large region by a rather limited number of cells, so that there is practically no limitations for the distance between the systems. However, both disks must lie on the orbital plane. In future the code will be applied to systematic survey of gravitationally induced activity in galaxies. Some preliminary results concerning tidal triggering of stellar bars and their effects on the gaseous component are presented.},

Applied to the time‐dependent incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, it virtually demands the use of implicit time integration methods in which full ‘velocity–pressure coupling' is also inherent. The high cost of such (high‐quality) FEM calculations led to the development of simpler but ad hoc methods in which the ‘lumped' mass matrix is employed and the velocity and pressure are uncoupled to the maximum extent possible. Resulting computer codes were less expensive to use but suffered a significant loss of accuracy, caused by lumping the mass when the flow was advection‐dominated and accurate transport of ‘information' was important. In the second part of this paper we re‐introduce the consistent mass matrix into some semi‐implicit projection methods in such a way that the cost advantage of lumped mass and the accuracy advantage of consistent mass are simultaneously realized.

abstract = {We analytically derive the observed size-mass relation of galaxies' atomic hydrogen (HI), including limits on its scatter, based on simple assumptions about the structure of HI discs. We trial three generic profiles for HI surface density as a function of radius. Firstly, we assert that HI surface densities saturate at a variable threshold, and otherwise fall off exponentially with radius or, secondly, radius squared. Our third model assumes the total gas surface density is exponential, with the HI fraction at each radius depending on local pressure. These are tested against a compilation of 110 galaxies from the THINGS, LITTLE THINGS, LVHIS, and Bluedisk surveys, whose HI surface density profiles are well resolved. All models fit the observations well and predict consistent size-mass relations. Using an analytical argument, we explain why processes that cause gas disc truncation - such as ram-pressure stripping - scarcely affect the HI size-mass relation. This is tested with the IllustrisTNG(100) cosmological, hydrodynamic simulation and the Dark Sage semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, both of which capture radially resolved disc structure. For galaxies with m{\_}*{\textgreater}10{\^{}}9 M{\_}solar and m{\_}HI{\textgreater}10{\^{}}8 M{\_}solar, both simulations predict HI size-mass relations that align with observations, show no difference between central and satellite galaxies, and show only a minor, second-order dependence on host halo mass for satellites. Ultimately, the universally tight HI size-mass relation is mathematically inevitable and robust. Only by completely disrupting the structure of HI discs, e.g. through overly powerful feedback, could a simulation predict the relation poorly.},

@article{Madden2020,
abstract = {While the CO(1-0) transition is often used to deduce the total molecular hydrogen in galaxies, it is challenging to detect in low metallicity galaxies, in spite of the star formation taking place. In contrast, the [CII] 158 micron line is relatively bright, highlighting a potentially important reservoir of H2 that is not traced by CO(1-0), but residing in the C+ - emitting regions. We explore a method to quantify the total H2 mass (MH2) in galaxies and learn what parameters control the CO-dark gas reservoir. We present Cloudy grids of density, radiation field and metallicity in terms of observed quantities, such as [OI], [CI], CO(1-0), [CII], total infrared luminosity and the total MH2 and provide recipes based on these models to derive total MH2 mass estimates from observations. The models are applied to the Herschel Dwarf Galaxy Survey, extracting the total MH2 for each galaxy which is compared to the H2 determined from the observed CO(1-0) line. While the H2 traced by CO(1-0) can be negligible, the [CII] 158 micron line can trace the total H2. 70{\%} to 100{\%} of the total H2 mass is not traced by CO(1-0) in the dwarf galaxies, but is well-traced by [CII] 158 micron line. The CO-dark gas mass fraction correlates with the observed L[CII]/LCO(1-0) ratio. A conversion factor for [CII] luminosity to total H2 and a new CO-to-total-MH2 conversion factor, as a function of metallicity, is presented. A recipe is provided to quantify the total mass of H2 in galaxies, taking into account the CO and [CII] observations. Accounting for this CO-dark H2 gas, we find that the star forming dwarf galaxies now fall on the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation. Their star-forming efficiency is rather normal, since the reservoir from which they form stars is now more massive when introducing the [CII] measures of the total H2, compared to the little amount of H2 in the CO-emitting region.},

abstract = {Hydrodynamic cosmological simulations at present usually employ either the Lagrangian SPH technique, or Eulerian hydrodynamics on a Cartesian mesh with adaptive mesh refinement. Both of these methods have disadvantages that negatively impact their accuracy in certain situations. We here propose a novel scheme which largely eliminates these weaknesses. It is based on a moving unstructured mesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete points. The mesh is used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal hydrodynamics with a finite volume approach, based on a second-order unsplit Godunov scheme with an exact Riemann solver. The mesh-generating points can in principle be moved arbitrarily. If they are chosen to be stationary, the scheme is equivalent to an ordinary Eulerian method with second order accuracy. If they instead move with the velocity of the local flow, one obtains a Lagrangian formulation of hydrodynamics that does not suffer from the mesh distortion limitations inherent in other mesh-based Lagrangian schemes. In this mode, our new method is fully Galilean-invariant, unlike ordinary Eulerian codes, a property that is of significant importance for cosmological simulations. In addition, the new scheme can adjust its spatial resolution automatically and continuously, and hence inherits the principal advantage of SPH for simulations of cosmological structure growth. The high accuracy of Eulerian methods in the treatment of shocks is retained, while the treatment of contact discontinuities improves. We discuss how this approach is implemented in our new parallel code AREPO, both in 2D and 3D. We use a suite of test problems to examine the performance of the new code and argue that it provides an attractive and competitive alternative to current SPH and Eulerian techniques. (abridged)},

abstract = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) was invented to simulate nonaxisymmetric phenomena in astrophysics (Lucy 1977, Gingold {\&} Monaghan 1977). We wanted a method that was easy to work with and could give reasonable accuracy. The SPH method satisfied these require- ments. As a bonus we found the SPH was rugged, gave sensible answers in difficult situations, and could be extended to complicated physics with- out much trouble. The SPH method is a particle method. Unlike the particle in cell method (PIC) (Harlow 1957, 1974, 1988), SPH does not need a grid to calculate spatial derivatives. Instead, they are found by analytical differentiation of interpolation formulae. The equations of momentum and energy become sets of ordinary differential equations which are easy to understand in mechanical and thermodynamical terms. For example, the pressure gradi- ent becomes a force between pairs of particles. The astrophysicist can then use intuition in a way which is difficult with the original partial differential equations. This intuition, coupled with detailed analysis, has allowed SPH to be extended to a wide variety of astrophysical problems. Although very accurate finite-difference methods exist-and these are better than SPH for some problems-they cannot handle complex physics in three dimensions with the same ease. Various aspects of SPH have been reviewed by Monaghan (1985, 1988a) and Benz (1988, 1989).},

As a result of dynamical heating, older stars are less centrally concentrated than younger stars, similar to stellar population gradients observed in nearby dwarf galaxies.

The simulated galaxies formed most of their stars in many {\$}\backslashsim{\$}10 Myr long bursts. The CDM galaxy has a global SFH, HI abundance and Fe/H and alpha-elements distribution well matched to current observations of dwarf galaxies.

abstract = {We present our methods for generating a catalog of 7,000 synthetic images and 40,000 integrated spectra of redshift z = 0 galaxies from the Illustris Simulation. The mock data products are produced by using stellar population synthesis models to assign spectral energy distributions (SED) to each star particle in the galaxies. The resulting synthetic images and integrated SEDs therefore properly reflect the spatial distribution, stellar metallicity distribution, and star formation history of the galaxies. From the synthetic data products it is possible to produce monochromatic or color-composite images, perform SED fitting, classify morphology, determine galaxy structural properties, and evaluate the impacts of galaxy viewing angle. The main contribution of this paper is to describe the production, format, and composition of the image catalog that makes up the Illustris Simulation Obsevatory. As a demonstration of this resource, we derive galactic stellar mass estimates by applying the SED fitting code FAST to the synthetic galaxy products, and compare the derived stellar masses against the true stellar masses from the simulation. We find from this idealized experiment that systematic biases exist in the photometrically derived stellar mass values that can be reduced by using a fixed metallicity in conjunction with a minimum galaxy age restriction.},

abstract = {We present two new Lagrangian methods for hydrodynamics, in a systematic comparison with moving-mesh, SPH, and stationary (non-moving) grid methods. The new methods are designed to simultaneously capture advantages of both smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and grid-based/adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) schemes. They are based on a kernel discretization of the volume coupled to a high-order matrix gradient estimator and a Riemann solver acting over the volume 'overlap.' We implement and test a parallel, second-order version of the method with self-gravity {\&} cosmological integration, in the code GIZMO: this maintains exact mass, energy and momentum conservation; exhibits superior angular momentum conservation compared to all other methods we study; does not require 'artificial diffusion' terms; and allows the fluid elements to move with the flow so resolution is automatically adaptive. We consider a large suite of test problems, and find that on all problems the new methods appear competitive with moving-mesh schemes, with some advantages (particularly in angular momentum conservation), at the cost of enhanced noise. The new methods have many advantages vs. SPH: proper convergence, good capturing of fluid-mixing instabilities, dramatically reduced 'particle noise' {\&} numerical viscosity, more accurate sub-sonic flow evolution, {\&} sharp shock-capturing. Advantages vs. non-moving meshes include: automatic adaptivity, dramatically reduced advection errors {\&} numerical overmixing, velocity-independent errors, accurate coupling to gravity, good angular momentum conservation and elimination of 'grid alignment' effects. We can, for example, follow hundreds of orbits of gaseous disks, while AMR and SPH methods break down in a few orbits. However, fixed meshes minimize 'grid noise.'

One such assumption is that gravity is governed by the theory of general relativity. In this review, we discuss how one might go about extending general relativity and how such extensions can be described in a unified way on large scales. This allows us to describe the phenomenology of modified gravity in the growth and morphology of the large-scale structure of the Universe. On smaller scales, we explore the physics of gravitational screening and how it might manifest itself in galaxies, clusters, and, more generally, in the cosmic web. We then analyze the current constraints from large-scale structure and conclude by discussing the future prospects of the field in light of the plethora of surveys currently being planned. Key results include the following: □ There are a plethora of alternative theories of gravity that are restricted by fundamental physics considerations. □ There is now a well-established formalism for describing cosmological perturbations in the linear regime for general theories of gravity. □ Gravitational screening can mask modifications to general relativity on small scales but may, itself, lead to distinctive signatures in the large-scale structure of the Universe. □ Current constraints on both linear and nonlinear scales may be affected by systematic uncertainties that limit our ability to rule out alternatives to general relativity. □ The next generation of cosmological surveys will dramatically improve constraints on general relativity, by up to two orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {We analyze the stellar kinematics of 39 dwarf early-type galaxies (dEs) in the Virgo cluster. Based on the specific stellar angular momentum lambda{\_}e and the ellipticity, we find 11 slow rotators and 28 fast rotators. The fast rotators in the outer parts of the Virgo cluster rotate significantly faster than fast rotators in the inner parts of the cluster. Moreover, 10 out of the 11 slow rotators are located in the inner 3 degrees (D {\textless} 1 Mpc) of the cluster. The fast rotators contain subtle disky structures that are visible in high-pass filtered optical images, while the slow rotators do not exhibit these structures. In addition, two of the dEs have kinematically decoupled cores and four more have emission partially filling in the Balmer absorption lines. These properties suggest that Virgo cluster dEs may have originated from late-type star-forming galaxies that were transformed by the environment after their infall into the cluster. The correlation between lambda{\_}e and the clustercentric distance can be explained by a scenario where low luminosity star-forming galaxies fall into the cluster, their gas is rapidly removed by ram pressure stripping, although some of it can be retained in their core, their star-formation is quenched but their stellar kinematics are preserved. After a long time in the cluster and several passes through its center, the galaxies are heated up and transformed into slow rotating dEs.},

abstract = {A shock wave in a weakly ionized gas can be preceeded by a charge separation region if the Debye length is larger than the shock width. It has been proposed that electrostatic contributions to pressure in the charge separation region can increase the sound speed ahead of the shock well above the sound speed in a neutral gas at the same temperature and therefore increase the shock propagation speed. This proposal is investigated numerically and theoretically. It is concluded that although the ion gas becomes strongly non-ideal in the charge separation region, there is no appreciable effect on the neutral shock. 1. Introduction. Ionized fluid systems are effectively electrically neutral at length scales larger than the Debye length, the scale at which charge screening becomes important [1]. In shock waves in weakly ionized gases, the great mass disparity between electrons and ions promotes the formation of a charge separation region near the neutral shock front. The size of this region is of the order of the Debye length; it might modify the shock dynamics if the Debye length is larger than the shock width [2]. Experimental observations [3] suggest that shock propagation in weakly ionized gases is 'anomalous' in some respects; for example, shocks appear to travel faster than they would in a completely neutral gas at the same temperature and pressure. It has been proposed [4] that the unscreened electrostatic forces in the charge separation region could cause a significant increase in pressure ahead of the shock, leading to the sound speed increase thought to be responsible for these effects. This pressure increase was at first estimated to be quite large [4]; however, it cannot simply be added to the neutral pressure. Only a weaker conclusion is possible, namely that electrostatic effects cause the ion and electron gases to become strongly non-ideal in the charge separation region. Any mechanism which increases shock propagation speeds requires an energy source in the medium into which the shock propagates. In this proposal, the energy source is the electrostatic potential energy in the charge separation region. This possibility is attractive, because the existence of the charge separation region requires a large Debye length, hence a relatively low density of charged particles. If the 'anomalous effects' are real and are associated with the existence of the charge separation region, then the effects must vanish both in the limit of very high charged particle density, corresponding to a small Debye length, and in the limit of very low density, corresponding to a large Debye length but no charged particles, hence to an effectively purely neutral shock. This would explain the absence of 'anomalous effects' on re-entry vehicles and suggests that an optimal density might exist at which the anomalous effects are most pronounced. This possibility is investigated numerically and theoretically. Increased ion pressure alone is found to have no effect on the neutral shock, but the shock can be accelerated by an increased neutral pressure, even if the increase only occurs in the charge separation region. However, because the electrostatic force},

abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree'-method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different timesteps. Individual and adaptive short-range timesteps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelisation algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 10{\^{}}10 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 10{\^{}}5 per dimension in a 3D box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

abstract = {While N-body simulations suggest a cuspy profile in the centra of the dark matter halos of galaxies, the majority of astronomical observations favor a relatively soft cored density distribution of these regions. The routine method of testing the convergence of N-body simulations (in particular, the negligibility of two-body scattering effect) is to find the conditions under which formed structures is insensitive to numerical parameters. The results obtained with this approach suggest a surprisingly minor role of the particle collisions: the central density profile remains untouched and close to the Navarro-Frenk-White shape, even if the simulation time significantly exceeds the collisional relaxation time$\tau$r. In order to check the influence of the unphysical test body collisions we use the Fokker-Planck equation. It turns out that a profile $\rho$∞r-$\beta$where $\beta$ ≃1 is an attractor: the Fokker-Planck diffusion transforms any reasonable initial distribution into it in a time shorter than$\tau$r, and then the cuspy profile should survive much longer than$\tau$r, since the Fokker-Planck diffusion is self-compensated if $\beta$ ≃1. Thus the purely numerical effect of test body scattering may create a stable NFW-like pseudosolution. Moreover, its stability may be mistaken for the simulation convergence. We present analytical estimations for this potential bias effect and call for numerical tests. For that purpose, we suggest a simple test that can be performed as the simulation progresses and would indicate the magnitude of the collisional influence and the veracity of the simulation results. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This evidence is consistent with the idea that rotationally supported dwarfs are late-type spirals or irregulars that recently entered the cluster and lost their gas through a ram pressure stripping event, quenching their star formation and becoming dEs through passive evolution. We also find that all, but one, galaxies without photometric hints for hosting disks are pressure supported and are all situated in the inner regions of the cluster. This suggests a different evolution from the rotationally supported systems. Three different scenarios for these non-rotating galaxies are discussed (in situ formation, harassment, and ram pressure stripping). {\textcopyright} 2009. The American Astronomical Society.

Our spatially resolved spectroscopy, combined with a cluster sample with negligible relative distance errors, allows us to derive a Fundamental Plane with minimal systematic uncertainties. From the apertures we tested, we find that velocity dispersions measured within a circular aperture with radius equal to one effective radius minimizes the intrinsic scatter of the Fundamental Plane. Using simple yet powerful Jeans dynamical models, we determine dynamical masses for our galaxies. Replacing luminosity in the Fundamental Plane with dynamical mass, we demonstrate that the resulting Mass Plane has further reduced scatter, consistent with zero intrinsic scatter. Using these dynamical models, we also find evidence for a possibly non-linear relationship between dynamical mass-to-light ratio and velocity dispersion.},

In this manuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in using reduced chi-squared. There are two independent problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can only be estimated for linear models. Concerning nonlinear models, the number of degrees of freedom is unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the value of reduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise in the data, also the value of reduced chi-squared itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is uncertain. This uncertainty impairs the usefulness of reduced chi-squared for differentiating between models or assessing convergence of a minimisation procedure. The impact of noise on the value of reduced chi-squared is surprisingly large, in particular for small data sets, which are very common in astrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced chi-squared can only be used with due caution for linear models, whereas it must not be used for nonlinear models at all. Finally, we recommend more sophisticated and reliable methods, which are also applicable to nonlinear models.},

The molecular-to-atomic ratio is more tightly correlated with stellar surface density than metallicity, confirming that the interstellar gas pressure plays a key role in determining the balance between the two gaseous components of the interstellar medium. Virgo dwarfs follow the same linear trend between molecular gas mass and star formation rate as more massive spirals, but gas depletion timescales, {\$}\backslashtau{\_}{\{}dep{\}}{\$}, are not constant and range between 100 Myr and 6 Gyr. The interaction with the Virgo cluster environment is removing the atomic gas and dust components of the dwarfs, but the molecular gas appears to be less affected at the current stage of evolution within the cluster. However, the correlation between HI deficiency and the molecular gas depletion time suggests that the lack of gas replenishment from the outer regions of the disc is lowering the star formation activity.},

The approach is based on adaptive hierarchical refinement of friends-of-friends groups in six phase-space dimensions and one time dimension, which allows for robust (grid-independent, shape-independent, and noise-resilient) tracking of substructure; as such, it is named Rockstar (Robust Overdensity Calculation using K-Space Topologically Adaptive Refinement). Our method is massively parallel (up to 10{\^{}}5 CPUs) and runs on the largest current simulations ({\textgreater}10{\^{}}10 particles) with high efficiency (10 CPU hours and 60 gigabytes of memory required per billion particles analyzed). A previous paper (Knebe et al 2011) has shown Rockstar to have class-leading recovery of halo properties; we expand on these comparisons with more tests and higher-resolution simulations. We show a significant improvement in substructure recovery as compared to several other halo finders and discuss the theoretical and practical limits of simulations in this regard. Finally, we present results which demonstrate conclusively that dark matter halo cores are not at rest relative to the halo bulk or satellite average velocities and have coherent velocity offsets across a wide range of halo masses and redshifts. For massive clusters, these offsets can be up to 350 km/s at z=0 and even higher at high redshifts. Our implementation is publicly available at http://code.google.com/p/rockstar .},

Detailed studies of this process have, however, largely been limited to relatively modest examples affecting only the outermost gas layers of galaxies in nearby and/or low-mass galaxy clusters. We here present results from our search for extreme cases of gas-galaxy interactions in much more massive, X-ray selected clusters at {\$}z{\textgreater}0.3{\$}. Using Hubble Space Telescope snapshots in the F606W and F814W passbands, we have discovered dramatic evidence of ram-pressure stripping in which copious amounts of gas are first shock compressed and then removed from galaxies falling into the cluster. Vigorous starbursts triggered by this process across the galaxy-gas interface and in the debris trail cause these galaxies to temporarily become some of the brightest cluster members in the F606W passband, capable of outshining even the Brightest Cluster Galaxy. Based on the spatial distribution and orientation of systems viewed nearly edge-on in our survey, we speculate that infall at large impact parameter gives rise to particularly long-lasting stripping events.

abstract = {We present the analysis of a deep (167 ks) ROSAT HRI observation of the cD galaxy NGC 1399 in the Fornax cluster. Using both HRI and, at larger radii, archival PSPC data, we find that the radial behavior of the X-ray surface brightness profile is not consistent with a simple Beta model and suggests instead three distinct components. We use a multi-component bidimensional model to study in detail these three components that we identify respectively with the cooling flow region, the galactic and the cluster halo. From these data we derive a binding mass distribution in agreement with that suggested by optical dynamical indicators, with an inner core dominated by luminous matter and an extended dark halo differently distributed on galactic and cluster scales. The HRI data and a preliminary analysis of Chandra public data, allow us to detect significant density fluctuations in the halo. We discuss possible non-equilibrium scenarios to explain the hot halo structure, including tidal interactions with neighboring galaxies, ram stripping from the intra-cluster medium and merging events. In the innermost region of NGC 1399, the comparison between the X-ray and radio emission suggests that the radio emitting plasma is displacing and producing shocks in the hot X-ray emitting gas. We found that the NGC 1404 halo is well represented by a single symmetric Beta model and follows the stellar light profile within the inner 8 kpc. The mass distribution is similar to the `central' component of the NGC 1399 halo. At larger radii ram pressure stripping from the intra-cluster medium produces strong asymmetries in the gas distribution. Finally we discuss the properties of the point source population finding evidence of correlation between the source excess and NGC 1399.},

In contrast, field dwarfs not subjected to environmental stripping reach their maximum mass at z = 0. These different assembly trajectories naturally produce a colour bimodality, with blue isolated dwarfs and redder cluster dwarfs exhibiting negligible star formation today. The cessation of star formation happens over median times 3.5-5 Gyr depending on stellar mass, and shows a large scatter ({\~{}}1-8 Gyr), with the lower values associated with starburst events that occur at infall through the virial radius or pericentric passages.We argue that such starbursts together with the early assembly of cluster dwarfs can provide a natural explanation for the higher specific frequency of globular clusters (GCs) in cluster dwarfs, as found observationally. We present a simple model for the formation and stripping of GCs that supports this interpretation. The origin of dwarf ellipticals in clusters is, therefore, consistent with an environmentally driven evolution of field dwarf irregulars. However, the z = 0 field analogues of cluster dwarf progenitors have today stellar masses a factor of {\~{}}3 larger - a difference arising from the early truncation of star formation in cluster dwarfs.},

abstract = {Simulating dwarf galaxy halos in a reionizing Universe puts severe constraints on the sub-grid model employed in the simulations. Using the same sub-grid model that works for simulations without a UV-background (UVB) results in gas poor galaxies that stop forming stars very early on, except for halos with high masses. This is in strong disagreement with observed galaxies, which are gas rich and star forming down to a much lower mass range. To resolve this discrepancy, we ran a large suite of isolated dwarf galaxy simulations to explore a wide variety of sub-grid models and parameters, including timing and strength of the UVB, strength of the stellar feedback, and metallicity dependent Pop III feedback. We compared these simulations to observed dwarf galaxies by means of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR), which links the baryonic content of a galaxy to the observationally determined strength of its gravitational potential. We found that the results are robust to changes in the UVB. The strength of the stellar feedback shifts the results on the BTFR, but does not help to form gas rich galaxies at late redshifts. Only by including Pop III feedback are we able to produce galaxies that lie on the observational BTFR and that have neutral gas and ongoing star formation at redshift zero.},

abstract = {A conclusive model for the formation of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies still remains elusive. Owing to their proximity to the massive spirals Milky Way (MW) and M31, various environmental processes have been invoked to explain their origin. In this context, the tidal stirring model postulates that interactions with MW-sized hosts can transform rotationally supported dwarfs, resembling present-day dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies, into systems with the kinematic and structural properties of dSphs. Using N-body+SPH simulations, we investigate the dependence of this transformation mechanism on the gas fraction, fgas, in the disk of the progenitor dwarf. Our numerical experiments incorporate for the first time the combined effects of radiative cooling, ram-pressure stripping, star formation, supernova (SN) winds, and a cosmic UV background. For a given orbit inside the primary galaxy, rotationally supported dwarfs with gas fractions akin to those of observed dIrrs (fgas {\textgreater}= 0.5), demonstrate a substantially enhanced likelihood and efficiency of transformation into dSphs relative to their collisionless (fgas = 0) counterparts. We argue that the combination of ram-pressure stripping and SN winds causes the gas-rich dwarfs to respond more impulsively to tides, augmenting their transformation. When fgas {\textgreater}= 0.5, disky dwarfs on previously unfavorable low-eccentricity or large-pericenter orbits are still able to transform. On the widest orbits, the transformation is incomplete; the dwarfs retain significant rotational support, a relatively flat shape, and some gas, naturally resembling transition-type systems. We conclude that tidal stirring constitutes a prevalent evolutionary mechanism for shaping the structure of dwarf galaxies within the currently favored CDM cosmological paradigm.},

abstract = {We present the results of a spectroscopic survey of 675 bright (16.5{\textless}Bj{\textless}18) galaxies in a 6 degree field centred on the Fornax cluster with the FLAIR-II spectrograph on the UK Schmidt Telescope. We measured redshifts for 516 galaxies of which 108 were members of the Fornax Cluster. Nine of these are new cluster members previously misidentified as background galaxies. The cluster dynamics show that the dwarf galaxies are still falling into the cluster whereas the giants are virialised. Our spectral data reveal a higher rate of star formation among the dwarf galaxies than suggested by morphological classification: 35 per cent have H-alpha emission indicative of star formation but only 19 per cent were morphologically classified as late-types. The distribution of scale sizes is consistent with evolutionary processes which transform late-type dwarfs to early-type dwarfs. The fraction of dwarfs with active star formation drops rapidly towards the cluster centre. The star-forming dwarfs are concentrated in the outer regions of the cluster, the most extreme in an infalling subcluster. We estimate gas depletion time scales for 5 dwarfs with detected HI emission: these are long (of order 10 Gyr), indicating that active gas removal must be involved if they are transformed into gas-poor dwarfs as they fall further into the cluster. In agreement with our previous results, we find no compact dwarf elliptical (M32-like) galaxies in the Fornax Cluster.},

abstract = {The recent discovery of super-massive black holes (SMBHs) in the centers of high-mass ultra compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) suggests that at least some UCDs are the stripped nuclear star clusters of lower mass galaxies. Tracing these former nuclei of stripped galaxies provides a unique way to track the assembly history of a galaxy or galaxy cluster. In this paper we present a new method to estimate how many UCDs host an SMBH in their center and thus are stripped galaxy nuclei. We revisit the dynamical mass measurements that suggest many UCDs have more mass than expected from stellar population estimates, which recent observations have shown is due to the presence of an SMBH. We revise the stellar population mass estimates using a new empirical relation between the mass-to-light ratio (M/L) and metallicity, and use this to predict which UCDs are most likely to host an SMBH. This enables us to calculate the fraction of UCDs that host SMBHs across their entire luminosity range for the first time. We then apply the SMBH occupation fraction to the observed luminosity function of UCDs and estimate that in the Fornax and Virgo cluster alone there should be {\$}69{\^{}}{\{}+32{\}}{\_}{\{}-25{\}}{\$} stripped nuclei with SMBHs. This analysis shows that stripped nuclei with SMBHs are almost as common in clusters as present-day galaxy nuclei. We estimate the local SMBH number density in stripped nuclei to {\$}3-8\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}Mpc{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}, which represents a significant fraction (10-40$\backslash${\%}) of the SMBH density in the local Universe. These SMBHs hidden in stripped nuclei will increase expected event rates for tidal disruption events and SMBH-SMBH and SMBH-BH mergers. The existence of numerous stripped nuclei with SMBHs are a direct consequence of hierarchical galaxy formation, but until now their impact on the SMBH density had not been quantified.},

This sample is representative of the early-type population of galaxies in the absolute magnitude range -19.0 {\textless} Mr {\textless} -16.0. We analyze their absorption line-strength indices by means of index-index diagrams and scaling relations and use the stellar population models to interpret them. We present ages, metallicities and abundance ratios obtained from these dEs within an aperture size of Re/8. We calculate [Na/Fe] from NaD, [Ca/Fe] from Ca4227 and [Mg/Fe] from Mgb. We find that [Na/Fe] is under-abundant with respect to solar while [Mg/Fe] is around solar. This is exactly opposite to what is found for giant ellipticals, but follows the trend with metallicity found previously for the Fornax dwarf NGC 1396. We discuss possible formation scenarios that can result in such elemental abundance patterns and we speculate that dEs have disk-like SFH favouring them to originate from late-type dwarfs or small spirals. Na-yields appear to be very metal-dependent, in agreement with studies of giant ellipticals, probably due to the large dependence on the neutron-excess in stars. We conclude that dEs have undergone a considerable amount of chemical evolution, they are therefore not uniformly old, but have extended SFH, similar to many of the Local Group galaxies.},

abstract = {The presence of a dark matter core in the central kiloparsec of many dwarf galaxies has been a long standing problem in galaxy formation theories based on the standard cold dark matter paradigm. Recent cosmological simulations, based on Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics and rather strong feedback recipes have shown that it was indeed possible to form extended dark matter cores using baryonic processes related to a more realistic treatment of the interstellar medium. Using adaptive mesh refinement, together with a new, stronger supernovae feedback scheme that we have recently implemented in the RAMSES code, we show that it is also possible to form a prominent dark matter core within the well-controlled framework of an isolated, initially cuspy, 10 billion solar masses dark matter halo. Although our numerical experiment is idealized, it allows a clean and unambiguous identification of the dark matter core formation process. Our dark matter inner profile is well fitted by a pseudo-isothermal profile with a core radius of 800 pc. The core formation mechanism is consistent with the one proposed recently by Pontzen {\&} Governato. We highlight two key observational predictions of all simulations that find cusp-core transformations: (i) a bursty star formation history with peak to trough ratio of 5 to 10 and a duty cycle comparable to the local dynamical time; and (ii) a stellar distribution that is hot with v/sigma=1. We compare the observational properties of our model galaxy with recent measurements of the isolated dwarf WLM. We show that the spatial and kinematical distribution of stars and HI gas are in striking agreement with observations, supporting the fundamental role played by stellar feedback in shaping both the stellar and dark matter distribution.},

This method also make use of the fact that Gaussians provide good low-order fits to observed line profiles. The method yields measurements of the line strength, mean radial velocity, and the velocity dispersion as well as two extra parameters, h3 and h4, that measure asymmetric and symmetric deviations of the line profiles from a Gaussian, respectively. The new method was used to derive profiles for three elliptical galaxies which all have asymmetric line profiles on the major axis with symmetric deviations from a Gaussian. Results confirm that elliptical galaxies have complex structures due to their complex formation history.},

@article{Papastergis2016,
abstract = {Recent studies have established that extreme dwarf galaxies --whether satellites or field objects-- suffer from the so called "too big to fail" (TBTF) problem. Put simply, the TBTF problem consists of the fact that it is difficult to explain both the measured kinematics of dwarfs and their observed number density within the LCDM framework. The most popular proposed solutions to the problem involve baryonic feedback processes. For example, reionization and baryon depletion can decrease the abundance of halos that are expected to host dwarf galaxies. Moreover, feedback related to star formation can alter the dark matter density profile in the central regions of low-mass halos. In this article we assess the TBTF problem for field dwarfs, taking explicitly into account the baryonic effects mentioned above. We find that 1) reionization feedback cannot resolve the TBTF problem on its own, because the halos in question are too massive to be affected by it, and that 2) the degree to which profile modification can be invoked as a solution to the TBTF problem depends on the radius at which galactic kinematics are measured. Based on a literature sample of about 90 dwarfs with interferometric observations in the 21cm line of atomic hydrogen (HI), we conclude that the TBTF problem persists despite baryonic effects. However, the preceding statement assumes that the sample under consideration is representative of the general population of field dwarfs. In addition, the unexplained excess of dwarf galaxies in LCDM could be as small as a factor of {\~{}} 1.8, given the current uncertainties in the measurement of the galactic velocity function. Both of these caveats highlight the importance of upcoming uniform surveys with HI interferometers for advancing our understanding of the issue.},

@article{McCarthy2008,
abstract = {We use a large suite of carefully controlled full hydrodynamic simulations to study the ram pressure stripping of the hot gaseous halos of galaxies as they fall into massive groups and clusters. The sensitivity of the results to the orbit, total galaxy mass, and galaxy structural properties is explored. For typical structural and orbital parameters, we find that {\~{}}30{\%} of the initial hot galactic halo gas can remain in place after 10 Gyr. We propose a physically simple analytic model that describes the stripping seen in the simulations remarkably well. The model is analogous to the original formulation of Gunn {\&} Gott (1972), except that it is appropriate for the case of a spherical (hot) gas distribution (as opposed to a face-on cold disk) and takes into account that stripping is not instantaneous but occurs on a characteristic timescale. The model reproduces the results of the simulations to within approximately 10{\%} at almost all times for all the orbits, mass ratios, and galaxy structural properties we have explored. The one exception involves unlikely systems where the orbit of the galaxy is highly non-radial and its mass exceeds about 10{\%} of the group or cluster into which it is falling (in which case the model under-predicts the stripping following pericentric passage). The proposed model has several interesting applications, including modelling the ram pressure stripping of both observed and cosmologically-simulated galaxies and as a way to improve current semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. One immediate consequence is that the colours and morphologies of satellite galaxies in groups and clusters will differ significantly from those predicted with the standard assumption of complete stripping of the hot coronae.},

CO emission is observed in ten galaxies and marginally detected in another one. CO fluxes correlate with the FIR 250 $\mu$m emission, and the dwarfs follow the same linear relation that holds for more massive spiral galaxies extended to a wider dynamical range. We compare different methods to estimate H2 molecular masses, namely a metallicity-dependent CO-to-H2 conversion factor and one dependent on H-band luminosity. The molecular-to-stellar mass ratio remains nearly constant at stellar masses ≲ 109 M, contrary to the atomic hydrogen fraction, MHI M ∗, which increases inversely with M∗. The flattening of the MH2 M∗ ratio at low stellar masses does not seem to be related to the effects of the cluster environment because it occurs for both Hi-deficient and Hi-normal dwarfs. The molecular-to-atomic ratio is more tightly correlated with stellar surface density than metallicity, confirming that the interstellar gas pressure plays a key role in determining the balance between the two gaseous components of the interstellar medium. Virgo dwarfs follow the same linear trend between molecular gas mass and star formation rate as more massive spirals, but gas depletion timescales, $\tau$dep, are not constant and range between 100 Myr and 6 Gyr. The interaction with the Virgo cluster environment is removing the atomic gas and dust components of the dwarfs, but the molecular gas appears to be less affected at the current stage of evolution within the cluster. However, the correlation between Hi deficiency and the molecular gas depletion time suggests that the lack of gas replenishment from the outer regions of the disc is lowering the star formation activity.},

abstract = {Theoretical models for the expected merger rates of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are vital for planned gravitational-wave detection experiments such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Using collisionless {\$}N{\$}-body simulations of dwarf galaxy (DG) mergers, we examine how the orbital decay of IMBHs and the efficiency of IMBH binary formation depend on the central dark matter (DM) density profile of the merging DGs. Specifically, we explore various asymptotic inner slopes {\$}\backslashgamma{\$} of the DG's DM density distribution, ranging from steep cusps ({\$}\backslashgamma=1{\$}) to shallower density profiles ({\$}\backslashgamma{\textless}1{\$}), motivated by well-known baryonic-feedback effects as well as by DM models that differ from cold DM at the scales of DGs. We find that the inner DM slope is crucial for the formation (or lack thereof) of an IMBH binary; only mergers between DGs with cuspy DM profiles ({\$}\backslashgamma=1{\$}) are favourable to forming a hard IMBH binary, whereas when {\$}\backslashgamma{\textless}1{\$} the IMBHs stall at a separation of 50-100 pc. Consequently, the rate of LISA signals from IMBH coalescence will be determined by the fraction of DGs with a cuspy DM profile. Conversely, the LISA event rates at IMBH mass scales offer in principle a novel way to place constraints on the inner structure of DM halos in DGs and address the core-cusp controversy. We also show that, with spatial resolutions of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}0.1 kpc, as often adopted in cosmological simulations, all IMBHs stall, independent of {\$}\backslashgamma{\$}. This suggests caution in employing cosmological simulations of galaxy formation to study BH dynamics in DGs.},

abstract = {We present the first results of a deep Chandra survey of the inner {\~{}}1° of the Fornax cluster of galaxies. Ten 50 ks pointings were obtained in a mosaic centered on the giant elliptical galaxy NGC 1399 at the nominal cluster center. Emission and temperature maps of Fornax are presented, and an initial study of more than 700 detected X-ray point sources is made. Regions as small as 100 pc are resolved. The intracluster gas in Fornax exhibits a highly asymmetric morphology and temperature structure, dominated by a 180 kpc extended "plume" of low surface brightness, cool (≤1 keV) gas to the northeast of NGC 1399 with a sharper edge to the southwest. The elliptical galaxy NGC 1404 also exhibits a cool halo of X-ray gas within the cluster, with a highly sharpened leading edge as it presumably falls into the cluster and a comet-like tail. We estimate that some {\~{}}200-400 point sources are physically associated with Fornax. Confirming earlier works, we find that the globular cluster population in NGC 1399 is highly X-ray active, extending to globular clusters that may in fact be intracluster systems. We have also found a remarkable correlation between the location of giant and dwarf cluster galaxies and the presence of X-ray counterparts, such that systems inhabiting regions of low gas density are more likely to show X-ray activity. Not only does this correlate with the asymmetry of the intracluster gas, but it also correlates with the axis joining the center of Fornax to an infalling group 1 Mpc to the southwest. We suggest that Fornax may be experiencing either an intergalactic "headwind" due to motion relative to the surrounding large-scale structure or that the intracluster medium has been disturbed relative to the overall cluster gravitational potential by previous activity.},

IFU data obtained by us unambiguously confirm ram-pressure stripping as the physical mechanism driving the optical morphology and high star-formation rate of this system by revealing extended [O II]$\lambda$3727{\AA} emission up to 40 kpc (in projection) downstream, as well as an ordered radial-velocity field generated by (a) conservation of angular momentum of the interstellar gas stripped from the edge of the galactic disk and (b) drag forces exerted by the intra-cluster medium on the “tentacles” of stripped material. We find no evidence of significant nuclear activity in A1758N JFG1, although an AGN might, at this early stage of the stripping process, be obscured by high column densities of gas and dust near the galactic core. Finally, our exploration of possible trajectories of A1758N JFG1 found solutions consistent with the notions (a) that the A1758N merger proceeds along an axis that is substantially inclined with respect to the plane of the sky and (b) that A1758N JFG1 participated in the merger, rather than having been accreted independently from the field.},

abstract = {The faint-end slope of the galaxy mass function is usually reproduced in $\Lambda$CDM galaxy formation models by assuming that the fraction of baryons that turns into stars drops steeply with decreasing halo mass and essentially vanishes in haloes with maximum circular velocities V max {\textless} 20–30 km s −1 . Dark matter-dominated dwarfs should there-fore have characteristic velocities of about that value, unless they are small enough to probe only the rising part of the halo circular velocity curve (i.e., half-mass radii, r 1/2 1 kpc). Many dwarfs have properties in disagreement with this prediction: they are large enough to probe their halo V max but their characteristic velocities are well below 20 km s −1 . These 'cold faint giants' (an extreme example is the recently dis-covered Crater 2 Milky Way satellite) can only be reconciled with our $\Lambda$CDM models if they are the remnants of once massive objects heavily affected by tidal stripping. We examine this possibility using the APOSTLE cosmological hydrodynamical simu-lations of the Local Group. Assuming that low velocity dispersion satellites have been affected by stripping, we infer their progenitor masses, radii, and velocity dispersions, and find them in remarkable agreement with those of isolated dwarfs. Tidal stripping also explains the large scatter in the mass discrepancy-acceleration relation in the dwarf galaxy regime: tides remove preferentially dark matter from satellite galaxies, lowering their accelerations below the a min ∼ 10 −11 m s −2 minimum expected for iso-lated dwarfs. In many cases, the resulting velocity dispersions are inconsistent with the predictions from Modified Newtonian Dynamics, a result that poses a possibly insurmountable challenge to that scenario.},

Owing to the extreme dynamic range of galaxy formation, advances are driven by novel approaches using simulations with different tradeoffs between volume and resolution. Large-volume but low-resolution simulations provide the best statistics, while higher resolution simulations of smaller cosmic volumes can be evolved with more self-consistent physics and reveal important emergent phenomena.

abstract = {Deep observations of the dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxy NGC 1396 (MV =-16.60, Mass {\~{}}4 × 108 Mo˙), located in the Fornax cluster, have been performed with the Very Large Telescope/Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer spectrograph in the wavelength region from 4750 to 9350 {\AA}. In this paper, we present a stellar population analysis studying chemical abundances, the star formation history (SFH) and the stellar initial mass function (IMF) as a function of galactocentric distance. Different, independent ways to analyse the stellar populations result in a luminosity-weighted age of {\~{}}6 Gyr and a metallicity [Fe/H]{\~{}}-0.4, similar to other dEs of similar mass. We find unusually overabundant values of [Ca/Fe] {\~{}}+ 0.1, and underabundant Sodium, with [Na/Fe] values around -0.1, while [Mg/Fe] is overabundant at all radii, increasing from {\~{}}+ 0.1 in the centre to {\~{}}+ 0.2 dex. We notice a significant metallicity and age gradient within this dwarf galaxy. To constrain the stellar IMF of NGC 1396, we find that the IMF of NGC 1396 is consistent with either a Kroupa-like or a top-heavy distribution, while a bottom-heavy IMF is firmly ruled out. An analysis of the abundance ratios, and a comparison with galaxies in the Local Group, shows that the chemical enrichment history of NGC 1396 is similar to the Galactic disc, with an extended SFH. This would be the case if the galaxy originated from a Large Magellanic Cloud-sized dwarf galaxy progenitor, which would lose its gas while falling into the Fornax cluster.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2020. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved. With the published data of apparent axis ratios for 1109 ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) located in 17 low-redshift (z ∼ 0.020-0.063) galaxy clusters and 84 UDGs in two intermediate-redshift (z ∼ 0.308-0.348) clusters, we take advantage of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach and assume a triaxial model to investigate the intrinsic morphologies of UDGs. In contrast to the conclusion of Burkert, i.e., the underlying shapes of UDGs are purely prolate (C = B {\textless} A), we find that the data favor the oblate-triaxial models (i.e., thick disks with C{\textless} B∼A) over the nearly prolate ones. We also find that the intrinsic morphologies of UDGs are related to their stellar masses/luminosities, environments, and redshifts. First, the more luminous UDGs have puffier morphologies compared with the less luminous counterparts; the UDG morphologic dependence on luminosity is distinct from that of the typical quiescent dwarf ellipticals (dEs) and dwarf spheroidals (dSphs); in this sense, UDGs may not be simply treated as an extension of the dE/dSph class with similar evolutionary histories; they may differ not only in size. Second, the UDGs with smaller clustercentric distances are more puffed up, compared with the counterparts with larger clustercentric distances; in combination with the UDG thickness dependence on luminosity, the puffier morphologies of UDGs with high luminosities or located in the denser environments are very likely to be attributed to tidal interactions with massive galaxies. Third, we find that the intermediate-redshift UDGs are more flattened, compared with the low-redshift counterparts, which plausibly suggests a "disky"origin for the high-redshift, newly born UDGs.},

abstract = {A new harassment model is presented that models the complex and dynamical tidal field of a Virgo-like galaxy cluster. The model is applied to small, late-type dwarf disc galaxies (of substantially lower mass than in previous harassment simulations) as they infall into the cluster from the outskirts. These dwarf galaxies are only mildly affected by high-speed tidal encounters with little or no observable consequences; typical stellar losses are {\textless}10 per cent, producing very low surface brightness streams ($\mu$B {\textgreater} 31 mag arcsec−2) and a factor of 2 drop in dynamical mass-to-light ratio. Final stellar discs remain disc like, and dominated by rotation although often with tidally induced spiral structure. By means of Monte Carlo simulations, the statistically likely influences of harassment on infalling dwarf galaxies are determined. The effects of harassment are found to be highly dependent on the orbit of the galaxy within the cluster, such that newly accreted dwarf galaxies typically suffer only mild harassment. Strong tidal encounters, that can morphologically transform discs into spheroidals, are rare occurring in {\textless}15 per cent of dwarf galaxy infalls for typical orbits of substructure within Lambda cold dark matter cluster mass haloes. For orbits with small apocentric distances ({\textless}250 kpc), harassment is significantly stronger resulting is in complete disruption or heavy mass loss ({\textgreater}90 per cent dark matter and {\textgreater}50 per cent stellar), however, such orbits are expected to be highly improbable for newly infalling galaxies due to the deep potential well of the cluster.},

abstract = {H I spatial power spectra were determined for a sample of 24 nearby dwarf irregular galaxies selected from the Local Irregulars That Trace Luminosity Extremes-The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey sample. The two-dimensional power spectral indices asymptotically become a constant for each galaxy when a significant part of the line profile is integrated. For narrow channel maps, the power spectra become shallower as the channel width decreases, and this shallowing trend continues to our single channel maps. This implies that even the highest velocity resolution of 1.8 km s–1 is not smaller than the thermal dispersion of the coolest, widespread H I component. The one-dimensional power spectra of azimuthal profiles at different radii suggest that the shallower power spectra for narrower channel width is mainly contributed by the inner disks, which indicates that the inner disks have proportionally more cooler H I than the outer disks. Galaxies with lower luminosity (MB {\textgreater} –14.5 mag) and star formation rate (SFR, log(SFR (M {\&}sun; yr–1)) {\textless} –2.1) tend to have steeper power spectra, which implies that the H I line-of-sight depths can be comparable with the radial length scales in low-mass galaxies. A lack of a correlation between the inertial-range spectral indices and SFR surface density implies that either non-stellar power sources are playing a fundamental role in driving the interstellar medium turbulent structure or the nonlinear development of turbulent structures has little to do with the driving sources. Based on data from the LITTLE THINGS Survey (D. A. Hunter et al., in preparation).},

abstract = {We investigate the effects of ram pressure stripping on gas-rich disc galaxies in the cluster environment. Ram pressure stripping principally affects the atomic gas in disc galaxies, stripping away outer disc gas to a truncation radius. We demonstrate that the drag force exerted on truncated gas discs is passed to the stellar disc, and surrounding dark matter through their mutual gravity. Using a toy model of ram pressure stripping, we show that this can drag a stellar disc and dark matter cusp off centre within its dark matter halo by several kiloparsecs. We present a simple analytical description of this process that predicts the drag force strength and its dependency on ram pressures and disc galaxy properties to first order. The motion of the disc can result in temporary deformation of the stellar disc. However, we demonstrate that the key source of stellar disc heating is the removal of the gas potential from within the disc. This can result in disc thickening by approximately a factor of 2 in gas-rich discs.},

I comment on steps in this development I think I understand because I was there or, in some cases, wish I had been. Wonderful insights-or lucky guesses-and elegant deductions from measurements were accompanied by the usual mix of unlucky guesses and disregard of unwelcome evidence. I say usual because I suspect the course of development of any other natural science is similarly erratic. An example in cosmology is Einstein's homogeneous Universe, which was largely accepted as a working hypothesis when there was scant evidence and seriously challenged after we had a reasonable case for homogeneity. Similar mixes of insight and inattention led to the eventual identification of the 3K microwave background, the demonstration that large-scale structure grew by the gravitational instability of the expanding Universe, and the completion of a tight network of cosmological tests. A half century ago, we had little idea what would become of what we were doing in cosmology. We have a better picture now, but I expect there to be more surprises.

This is because the dark matter halo is initially much more extended than the stars. As such, we find the stellar-to-halo size-ratio (measured using r{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}eff{\}}{\}}{\$}/r{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}vir{\}}{\}}{\$}) is a key parameter controlling the relative amounts of dark matter and stellar stripping. We use simple fitting formulae to measure the relation between the fraction of bound dark matter and fraction of bound stars. We measure a negligible dependence on cluster mass or galaxy mass. Therefore these formulae have general applicability in cosmological simulations, and are ideal to improve stellar stripping recipes in semi-analytical models, and/or to estimate the impact that tidal stripping would have on galaxies when only their halo mass evolution is known.},

Previous studies have tried to explain the distribution by using adiabatic self-similar evolution of wind-driven bubbles, assuming that bubbles stall when pressure equilibrium is reached. We show, with the help of hydrodynamical numerical simulations, that this assumption is not valid. We also include radiative cooling of shells. In order to take into account non-thermal pressure in the ambient medium, we assume an equivalent higher temperature than implied by thermal pressure alone. Assuming that bubbles stall when the outer shock speed becomes comparable to the ambient sound speed (which includes non-thermal components), we recover the size distribution with a slope of ∼-2.7 for typical values of interstellar medium pressure in Milky Way, which is consistent with observations. Our simulations also allow us to follow the evolution of size distribution in the case of different values of non-thermal pressure, and we show that the size distribution steepens with lower pressure, to slopes intermediate between only-growing and only-stalled cases.},

We applied color and size selection criteria to select old GC candidates and made use of archival ACS images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope to reject contaminating background sources and blended objects from the GC candidates' list. The H$\alpha$ observations were used to check for contamination due to compact, highly reddened young star clusters whose colors and sizes could mimic those of old GCs. After accounting for contamination we obtain a total number of GC candidates with colors consistent with an old ({\~{}}10 Gyr) and metal-poor () population as judged by simple stellar population models. Our contamination analysis indicates that the density distribution of GCs in the outskirts of the Fornax central cD galaxy NGC 1399 may not be spherically symmetric. We derive a present-day specific frequency SN of 1.6 for NGC 1427A, a value significantly larger than what is observed in the Local Group dwarf irregular galaxies and comparable with the values found for the same galaxy types in the Virgo and Fornax clusters. Assuming a universal globular cluster luminosity function turnover magnitude, we derive a distance modulus to NGC 1427A of mag which places it Mpc in front of the Fornax central cD galaxy NGC 1399. The implications of this result for the relationship between NGC 1427A and the cluster environment are briefly discussed.},

We find anomalously low metallicity (ALM) gas in 10{\%} of the star-forming spaxels, and in 25{\%} of the galaxies in the sample. The incidence rate of ALM gas increases strongly with both global and local measures of the specific star-formation rate, and is higher in lower mass galaxies and in the outer regions of galaxies. The incidence rate is also significantly higher in morphologically disturbed galaxies. We estimate that the lifetimes of the ALM regions are a few hundred Myr. We argue that the ALM gas has been delivered to its present location by a combination of interactions, mergers, and accretion from the halo, and that this infusion of gas stimulates star-formation. Given the estimated lifetime and duty cycle of such events, we estimate that the time-averaged accretion rate of ALM gas is similar to the star-formation rate in late type galaxies over the mass-range M{\$}{\_}* \backslashsim10{\^{}}9{\$} to 10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}.},

Through a series of numerical simulations, we show that in dwarf galaxies with a relatively weak external tidal perturbation dynamical friction can lead to significant orbital decays of globular clusters and the formation of compact nuclei within a Hubble timescale. Similar tendencies also occur in those dwarf galaxies near the center of clusters of galaxies where the extragalactic tidal perturbation tends to preserve the integrity of dwarf galaxies. Based on these numerical simulations, we show that the observed central structures of four nucleated dwarf galaxies in the Virgo Cluster are well modeled by superimposing a small number of globular clusters onto the background stellar distribution. We also deduce a flat mass-weighted velocity-dispersion distribution that is consistent with some recent observations and suggest that the cores of nucleated dwarfs may be slightly off center within {\~{}}1 Gyr after each globular cluster merger event. In the outskirts of clusters of galaxies external tidal perturbation tends to disrupt dwarf galaxies and prevent the sedimentation of the globular clusters within them. We speculate that the residual nucleated dwarf galaxies near the central regions of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies may be the first entities to have congregated and remained there. Such a scenario is consistent with the cold dark matter hypothesis for galaxy formation.},

abstract = {Attention has been drawn to the importance of environmental effects, given a strong morphological segregation of the dwarf galaxies. A simple quantitative test for segregation between dwarfs and giants is suggested. The dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies are considered to be confined to the clouds and to strongly prefer dense environments on all scales. Their abundance (per giant) is observed to be much lower in the field than in the clusters and the few dE systems outside of the clusters (i.e., in the clouds) look like companions to the giant galaxies. Thus, the dwarf galaxies are shown to obey a morphology-density relation in the same way as the giants do, and not only in the restricted environment of the Virgo cluster.},

abstract = {We investigate the impact of star formation and feedback on ram pressure stripping using high-resolution adaptive mesh simulations, building on a previous series of papers that systematically investigated stripping using a realistic model for the interstellar medium, but without star formation. We find that star formation does not significantly affect the rate at which stripping occurs, and only has a slight impact on the density and temperature distribution of the stripped gas, indicating that our previous (gas-only) results are unaffected. For our chosen (moderate) ram pressure strength, stripping acts to truncate star formation in the disc over a few hundred million years, and does not lead to a burst of star formation. Star formation in the bulge is slightly enhanced, but the resulting change in the bulge-to-disc ratio is insignificant. We find that stars do form in the tail, primarily from gas that is ablated from the disc and the cools and condenses in the turbulent wake. The star formation rate in the tail is low, and any contribution to the intracluster light is likely to be very small. We argue that star formation in the tail depends primarily on the pressure in the intracluster medium, rather than the ram pressure strength. Finally, we compare to observations of star formation in stripped tails, finding that many of the discrepancies between our simulation and observed wakes can be accounted for by different intracluster medium pressures.},

The galaxies exhibit strong Balmer absorption in the absence of ongoing star formation in more than 10{\%} of their spectra within the SAMI field of view. These {\$}\backslashrm{\{}H{\}}{\{}\backslashdelta{\}}{\$}-strong galaxies (HDSGs) are rare, making up only {\$}\backslashsim 2{\$}{\%} (25/1220) of galaxies with stellar mass {\$}{\{}\backslashrm log({\}}M{\_}*/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}){\textgreater}10{\$}. The HDSGs make up a significant fraction of non-passive cluster galaxies (15{\%}; 17/115) and a smaller fraction (2.0{\%}; 8/387) of the non-passive population in low-density environments. The majority (9/17) of cluster HDSGs show evidence for star formation at their centers, with the HDS regions found in the outer parts of the galaxy. Conversely, the {\$}\backslashrm{\{}H{\}}{\{}\backslashdelta{\}}{\$}-strong signal is more evenly spread across the galaxy for the majority (6/8) of HDSGs in low-density environments, and is often associated with emission lines that are not due to star formation. We investigate the location of the HDSGs in the clusters, finding that they are exclusively within 0.6{\$}R{\_}{\{}200{\}}{\$} of the cluster centre, and have a significantly higher velocity dispersion relative to the cluster population. Comparing their distribution in projected-phase-space to those derived from cosmological simulations indicates that the cluster HDSGs are consistent with an infalling population that have entered the central 0.5{\$}r{\_}{\{}200, 3D{\}}{\$} cluster region within the last {\$}\backslashsim 1\backslash,{\$}Gyr. In the 8/9 cluster HDSGs with central star formation, the extent of star formation is consistent with that expected of outside-in quenching by ram-pressure stripping. Our results indicate that the cluster HDSGs are currently being quenched by ram-pressure stripping on their first passage through the cluster.},

abstract = {We present a convenient, all-in-one framework for the scientific analysis of fully reduced, (integral-field) spectroscopic data. The Galaxy IFU Spectroscopy Tool ( GIST ) is entirely written in Python 3 and conducts all the steps from the preparation of input data to the scientific analysis and to the production of publication-quality plots. In its basic set-up, it extracts stellar kinematics, performs an emission-line analysis, and derives stellar population properties from full spectral fitting and via the measurement of absorption line-strength indices by exploiting the well-known pPXF and GandALF routines, where the latter has now been implemented in Python. The pipeline is not specific to any instrument or analysis technique and provides easy means of modification and further development, thanks to its modular code architecture. An elaborate, Python-native parallelisation is implemented and tested on various machines. The software further features a dedicated visualisation routine with a sophisticated graphical user interface. This allows an easy, fully interactive plotting of all measurements, spectra, fits, and residuals, as well as star formation histories and the weight distribution of the models. The pipeline has been successfully applied to both low- and high-redshift data from MUSE, PPAK (CALIFA), and SINFONI, and to simulated data for HARMONI and WEAVE and is currently being used by the TIMER, Fornax3D, and PHANGS collaborations. We demonstrate its capabilities by applying it to MUSE TIMER observations of NGC 1433.},

@article{Bullock2017,
abstract = {The dark energy plus cold dark matter ({\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM) cosmological model has been a demonstrably successful framework for predicting and explaining the large-scale structure of Universe and its evolution with time. Yet on length scales smaller than {\$}\backslashsim 1{\$} Mpc and mass scales smaller than {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, the theory faces a number of challenges. For example, the observed cores of many dark-matter dominated galaxies are both less dense and less cuspy than naively predicted in {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM. The number of small galaxies and dwarf satellites in the Local Group is also far below the predicted count of low-mass dark matter halos and subhalos within similar volumes. These issues underlie the most well-documented problems with {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM: Cusp/Core, Missing Satellites, and Too-Big-to-Fail. The key question is whether a better understanding of baryon physics, dark matter physics, or both will be required to meet these challenges. Other anomalies, including the observed planar and orbital configurations of Local Group satellites and the tight baryonic/dark matter scaling relations obeyed by the galaxy population, have been less thoroughly explored in the context of {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM theory. Future surveys to discover faint, distant dwarf galaxies and to precisely measure their masses and density structure hold promising avenues for testing possible solutions to the small-scale challenges going forward. Observational programs to constrain or discover and characterize the number of truly dark low-mass halos are among the most important, and achievable, goals in this field over then next decade. These efforts will either further verify the {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM paradigm or demand a substantial revision in our understanding of the nature of dark matter.},

@article{Planck2015,
abstract = {This paper presents cosmological results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis of the Planck nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision. The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base $\Lambda$CDM" in this paper). From the Planck temperature data combined with Planck lensing, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0 = (67.8 ± 0.9) km s-1Mpc-1, a matter density parameter $\Omega$m = 0.308 ± 0.012, and a tilted scalar spectral index with ns = 0.968 ± 0.006, consistent with the 2013 analysis. Note that in this abstract we quote 68{\%} confidence limits on measured parameters and 95{\%} upper limits on other parameters. We present the first results of polarization measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument at large angular scales. Combined with the Planck temperature and lensing data, these measurements give a reionization optical depth of $\tau$ = 0.066 ± 0.016, corresponding to a reionization redshift of $\backslash$hbox{\{}{\$}z-{\{}\backslashrm re{\}}=8.8{\{}+1.7{\}}-{\{}-1.4{\}}{\$}{\}}. These results are consistent with those from WMAP polarization measurements cleaned for dust emission using 353-GHz polarization maps from the High Frequency Instrument. We find no evidence for any departure from base $\Lambda$CDM in the neutrino sector of the theory; for example, combining Planck observations with other astrophysical data we find Neff = 3.15 ± 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, consistent with the value Neff = 3.046 of the Standard Model of particle physics. The sum of neutrino masses is constrained to {\^{a}}'m$\nu$ {\textless} 0.23 eV. The spatial curvature of our Universe is found to be very close to zero, with | $\Omega$K | {\textless} 0.005. Adding a tensor component as a single-parameter extension to base $\Lambda$CDM we find an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r0.002{\textless} 0.11, consistent with the Planck 2013 results and consistent with the B-mode polarization constraints from a joint analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP B-mode data to our analysis leads to a tighter constraint of r0.002 {\textless} 0.09 and disfavours inflationarymodels with a V($\phi$) $\phi$2 potential. The addition of Planck polarization data leads to strong constraints on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations. We find no evidence for any contribution from isocurvature perturbations or from cosmic defects. Combining Planck data with other astrophysical data, including Type Ia supernovae, the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w =-1.006 ± 0.045, consistent with the expected value for a cosmological constant. The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the best-fit Planck base $\Lambda$CDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We also constraints on annihilating dark matter and on possible deviations from the standard recombination history. In neither case do we find no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base $\Lambda$CDM are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the JLA sample of Type Ia supernovae. However, as in the 2013 analysis, the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is found to be higher than inferred from some analyses of rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. We show that these tensions cannot easily be resolved with simple modifications of the base $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Apart from these tensions, the base $\Lambda$CDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new calculation of composition-dependent radiative cooling and heating curves of low-density gas, intended primarily for use in numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution. These curves depend on only five parameters: temperature, density, redshift, [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe]. They are easily tabulated and can be efficiently interpolated during a simulation. The ionization equilibrium of 14 key elements is determined for temperatures between 10 K and 109 K and densities up to 100 amu cm-3 taking into account collisional and radiative ionization, by the cosmic UV background and an interstellar radiation field, and by charge-transfer reactions. These elements, ranging from H to Ni, are the ones most abundantly produced and/or released by SNIa, SNII and intermediate-mass stars. Self-shielding of the gas at high densities by neutral hydrogen is taken into account in an approximate way by exponentially suppressing the H-ionizing part of the cosmic UV background for H I densities above a threshold density of nHI, crit = 0.007 cm-3. We discuss how the ionization equilibrium, and the cooling and heating curves, depends on the physical properties of the gas. The main advantage of the work presented here is that, within the confines of a well-defined chemical evolution model and adopting the ionization equilibrium approximation, it provides accurate cooling and heating curves for a wide range of physical and chemical gas properties, including the effects of self-shielding. The latter is key to resolving the formation of cold, neutral, high-density clouds suitable for star formation in galaxy simulations.},

abstract = {Suzaku observed a central region and five offset regions within 0.2 r 180 in the Fornax cluster, a nearby poor cluster, and XMM-Newton mapped the cluster with 15 pointings out to 0.3 r180. The distributions of O, Mg, Si, S, and Fe in the intracluster medium (ICM) were studied with Suzaku, and those of Fe and temperature were studied with XMM. The temperature of the ICM gradually decreases with the radius from 1.3 keV at 0.04 r180 to 1 keV at 0.2-0.3 r180. If the new solar abundances of Lodders et al. (2003, ApJ, 591, 1220) and a single-temperature plasma model are adopted, O, Mg, Si, S, and Fe show similar abundances: 0.4-0.6 solar within 0.02-0.2 r180. This Fe abundance is similar to those at 0.1-0.2 r180 in rich clusters and other groups of galaxies. At 0.2-0.3 r 180, the Fe abundance becomes 0.2-0.3 solar. A two-temperature plasma model yields ICM abundances that are higher by a factor of 1.2-1.5, but give similar abundance ratios among O, Mg, Si, S, and Fe. The northern region has a lower ICM temperature and higher brightness and Fe abundance, whereas the southern region has a higher ICM temperature and lower brightness and Fe abundance. These results indicate that the cD galaxy may have traveled from the north because of recent dynamical evolution. The cumulative oxygen- and iron-mass-to-light ratios (OMLR and IMLR) within 0.3 r180 are an order of magnitude lower than those of rich clusters and some relaxed groups of galaxies. Past dynamical evolution might have hindered the strong concentration of hot gas in the Fornax cluster's central region. Scatter in the IMLR and similarity in the element abundances in the ICM of groups and clusters of galaxies indicate early metal synthesis. {\textcopyright} 2011. Astronomical Society of Japan.},

abstract = {We have generated synthetic images of ∼27 000 galaxies from the IllustrisTNG and the original Illustris hydrodynamic cosmological simulations, designed to match Pan-STARRS observations of log10(M∗/M{\textperiodcentered})-∼9.8-11.3 galaxies at z ∼0.05. Most of our synthetic images were created with the SKIRT radiative transfer code, including the effects of dust attenuation and scattering, and performing the radiative transfer directly on the Voronoi mesh used by the simulations themselves. We have analysed both our synthetic and real Pan-STARRS images with the newly developed statmorph code, which calculates non-parametric morphological diagnostics-including the Gini-M20 and concentration-asymmetry-smoothness statistics-and performs 2D Sersic fits. Overall, we find that the optical morphologies of IllustrisTNG galaxies are in good agreement with observations, and represent a substantial improvement compared to the original Illustris simulation. In particular, the locus of the Gini-M20 diagram is consistent with that inferred from observations, while the median trends with stellar mass of all the morphological, size and shape parameters considered in this work lie within the ∼1s scatter of the observational trends. However, the IllustrisTNG model has some difficulty with more stringent tests, such as producing a strong morphology-colour relation. This results in a somewhat higher fraction of red discs and blue spheroids compared to observations. Similarly, the morphology-size relation is problematic: while observations show that discs tend to be larger than spheroids at a fixed stellar mass, such a trend is not present in IllustrisTNG.},

abstract = {The Herschel Reference Survey is a complete volume-limited, K-band-selected sample of nearby objects including Virgo cluster and isolated objects. Using a recent compilation of Hi and CO data for this sample we study the effects of the cluster environment on the molecular gas content of spiral galaxies. With the subsample of unperturbed field galaxies, we first identify the stellar mass as the scaling variable that traces the total molecular gas mass of galaxies better. We show that, on average, Hi-deficient galaxies are significantly offset (4$\sigma$) from the M(H2) vs. Mstar relation for Hi-normal galaxies. We use the M(H2) vs. Mstar scaling relation to define the H2-deficiency parameter as the difference, on logarithmic scale, between the expected and observed molecular gas mass for a galaxy of given stellar mass. The H2-deficiency parameter shows a weak and scattered relation with the Hi-deficiency parameter, here taken as a proxy for galaxy interactions with the surrounding cluster environment. We also show that, as for the atomic gas, the extent of the molecular disc decreases with increasing Hi-deficiency. All together, these results show that cluster galaxies have, on average, a lower molecular gas content than similar objects in the field. Our analysis indicates that ram pressure stripping is the physical process responsible for this molecular gas deficiency. The slope of the H 2-def vs. Hi-def relation is less than unity, while the D(Hi)/D(i) vs. Hi-def relation is steeper than the D(CO)/D(i) vs. Hi-def relation, thereby indicating that the molecular gas is removed less efficiently than the atomic gas. This result can be understood if the atomic gas is distributed on a relatively flat disc that is more extended than the stellar disc. It is thus less anchored to the gravitational potential well of the galaxy than the molecular gas phase, which is distributed on an exponential disc with a scalelength rCO ≃ 0.2r24.5(g). There is a clear trend between the NUV-i colour index, which is a proxy for the specific star formation activity, and the H2-deficiency parameter, which suggests that molecular gas removal quenches the activity of star formation. This causes galaxies migrate from the blue cloud to the green valley and, eventually, to the red sequence. The total gas-consumption timescale of gas deficient cluster galaxies is comparable to that of isolated, unperturbed systems. The total gas depletion timescale determined by considering the recycled fraction is $\tau$gas,R ≃ 3.0-3.3 Gyr, which is significantly larger than the typical timescale for total gas removal in a ram pressure stripping process, indicated by recent hydrodynamical simulations to be $\tau$RP≃ 1.5 Gyr. The comparison of these timescales suggests that ram pressure, rather than a simple stop of the infall of pristine gas from the halo, will be the dominant process driving the future evolution of these cluster galaxies. {\textcopyright} 2014 ESO.},

abstract = {The difference in stellar metallicity between red and blue galaxies with the same mass constrains the timescale over which red galaxies ceased to form stars. Here we investigate this constraint with the GalICS 2.0 semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. The advantage of this approach is that the time of pericentric passages for satellite galaxies and the mass-loading factor for galactic winds are not free parameters of the chemical evolution model. The former is determined by the N-body simulation used to construct the merger trees, the latter by the requirement that GalICS 2.0 should reproduce the stellar mass function of galaxies. When we compare our theoretical predictions with observations, we find that GalICS 2.0 can reproduce the observed metallicity difference only if quenching is preceded by a burst of star formation, which contributes to the chemical enrichment of the stellar population. Physically, this burst can be explained as tidally-induced star formation or as an effect of ram pressure, which not only strips gas from galaxies but also compresses it, accelerating its conversion into stars.},

abstract = {Simulation codes for galaxy formation and evolution take on board as many physical processes as possible beyond the standard gravitational and hydrodynamical physics. Most of this extra physics takes place below the resolution level of the simulations and is added in a " sub-grid " fashion. However, these sub-grid processes affect the macroscopic hydrodynamical properties of the gas and thus couple to the " on-grid " physics that is explicitly integrated during the simulation. In this paper, we focus on the link between partial ionization and the hydrodynamical equa-tions. We show that the energy stored in ions and free electrons constitutes a potential energy term which breaks the linear dependence of the internal energy on temperature. Correctly tak-ing into account ionization hence requires modifying both the equation of state and the energy-temperature relation. We implemented these changes in the cosmological simulation code Gad-get2. As an example of the effects of these changes, we study the propagation of Sedov-Taylor shock waves through an ionizing medium. This serves as a proxy for the absorption of supernova feedback energy by the interstellar medium. Depending on the density and temperature of the surrounding gas, we find that up to 50{\%} of the feedback energy is spent ionizing the gas rather than heating it. Thus, it can be expected that properly taking into account ionization effects in galaxy evolution simulations will drastically reduce the effects of thermal feedback. To the best of our knowledge, this potential energy term is not used in current simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.},

abstract = {The origin of ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) is not yet clear. One possible formation path ofUCDs is the threshing of a nucleated elliptical dwarf galaxy (dE, N); however, it remains unclear how such massive nuclear stellar systems were formed in dwarf galaxies. To better establish the early history of UCDs, we investigate the formation of UCD progenitor clusters from supergiant molecular clouds (SGMCs), using hydrodynamical simulations. In this study we focus on SGMCs with masses 107-108 M⊙ that can form massive star clusters that display physical properties similar to UCDs. We find that the clusters have extended star formation histories with two phases, producing multiple distinct stellar populations, and that the star formation rate is dependent on the feedback effects of SNe and asymptotic giant branch stars. The later generations of stars formed in these clusters are more compact, leading to a clearly nested structure, and these stars will be more He-rich than those of the first generation, leading to a slight colour gradient. The simulated clusters demonstrate scaling relations between Reffand M, and $\sigma$v and M consistent with those observed in UCDs and strongly consistent with those of the original SGMC. We discuss whether SGMCs such as these can be formed through merging of self-gravitating molecular clouds in galaxies at high-z.},

abstract = {We study the role of systematic effects in observational studies of the cusp-core problem under the minimum disc approximation using a suite of high-resolution (25-pc softening length) hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxies. We mimic realistic kinematic observations and fit the mock rotation curves with two analytic models commonly used to differentiate cores from cusps in the dark matter distribution. We find that the cored pseudo-isothermal sphere (ISO) model is strongly favoured by the reduced {\$}\backslashchi{\^{}}2{\_}\backslashnu{\$} of the fits in spite of the fact that our simulations contain cuspy Navarro-Frenk-White profiles (NFW). We show that even idealized measurements of the gas circular motions can lead to the incorrect answer if velocity underestimates induced by pressure support, with a typical size of order {\$}\backslashsim{\$}5 km s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} in the central kiloparsec, are neglected. Increasing the spatial resolution of the mock observations leads to more misleading results because the inner region, where the effect of pressure support is most significant, is better sampled. Fits to observations with a spatial resolution of 100 pc (2 arcsec at 10 Mpc) favour the ISO model in 78-90 per cent of the cases, while at 800-pc resolution, 40-78 per cent of the galaxies indicate the fictitious presence of a dark matter core. The coefficients of our best-fit models agree well with those reported in observational studies; therefore, we conclude that NFW haloes can not be ruled out reliably from this type of analysis.},

abstract = {The Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project explores feedback in cosmological galaxy formation simulations. Previous FIRE simulations used an identical source code ('FIRE-1') for consistency. Motivated by the development of more accurate numerics - including hydrodynamic solvers, gravitational softening, and supernova coupling algorithms - and exploration of new physics (e.g. magnetic fields), we introduce 'FIRE-2', an updated numerical implementation of FIRE physics for the GIZMO code. We run a suite of simulations and compare against FIRE-1: overall, FIRE-2 improvements do not qualitatively change galaxy-scale properties. We pursue an extensive study of numerics versus physics. Details of the star formation algorithm, cooling physics, and chemistry have weak effects provided that we include metal-line cooling and star formation occurs at higher-than-mean densities. We present new resolution criteria for high-resolution galaxy simulations. Most galaxy-scale properties are robust to numerics we test, provided: (1) Toomre masses are resolved; (2) feedback coupling ensures conservation, and (3) individual supernovae are time-resolved. Stellar masses and profiles are most robust to resolution, followed by metal abundances and morphologies, followed by properties of winds and circum-galactic media. Central ({\~{}}kpc) mass concentrations in massive ({\textgreater} L*) galaxies are sensitive to numerics (via trapping/recycling of winds in hot haloes). Multiple feedback mechanisms play key roles: supernovae regulate stellar masses/winds; stellar mass-loss fuels late star formation; radiative feedback suppresses accretion on to dwarfs and instantaneous star formation in discs. We provide all initial conditions and numerical algorithms used.},

abstract = {Numerical methods have become a powerful tool for research in astrophysics, but their utility depends critically on the availability of suitable simulation codes. This calls for continuous efforts in code development, which is necessitated also by the rapidly evolving technology underlying today's computing hardware. Here we discuss recent methodological progress in the GADGET code, which has been widely applied in cosmic structure formation over the past two decades. The new version offers improvements in force accuracy, in time-stepping, in adaptivity to a large dynamic range in timescales, in computational efficiency, and in parallel scalability through a special MPI/shared-memory parallelization and communication strategy, and a more-sophisticated domain decomposition algorithm. A manifestly momentum conserving fast multipole method (FMM) can be employed as an alternative to the one-sided TreePM gravity solver introduced in earlier versions. Two different flavours of smoothed particle hydrodynamics, a classic entropy-conserving formulation and a pressure-based approach, are supported for dealing with gaseous flows. The code is able to cope with very large problem sizes, thus allowing accurate predictions for cosmic structure formation in support of future precision tests of cosmology, and at the same time is well adapted to high dynamic range zoom-calculations with extreme variability of the particle number density in the simulated volume. The GADGET-4 code is publicly released to the community and contains infrastructure for on-the-fly group and substructure finding and tracking, as well as merger tree building, a simple model for radiative cooling and star formation, a high dynamic range power spectrum estimator, and an initial conditions generator based on second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory.},

abstract = {Aims. As large-scale structures in the Universe develop with time, environmental effects become more and more important as a star formation quenching mechanism. Since the effects of environmental quenching are more pronounced in denser structures that form at later times, we seek to constrain environmental quenching processes using cluster galaxies at z{\textless} 0.3. Methods. We explored seven clusters from the Local Cluster Substructure Survey (LoCuSS) at 0.15{\textless} z{\textless} 0.26 with spectra of 1965 cluster members in a mass-complete sample from the ACReS (Arizona Cluster Redshift Survey) Hectospec survey covering a region that corresponds to about three virial radii for each cluster. We measured fluxes of [O II] $\lambda$ 3727, H$\beta$, [O III] $\lambda$ 5007, H$\alpha$, and [N II] $\lambda$ 6584 emission lines of cluster members, enabling us to unambiguously derive O/H gas metallicities. We also measured star formation rates (SFRs) from extinction-corrected H$\alpha$ fluxes. We compared our cluster galaxy sample with a field sample of 705 galaxies at similar redshifts observed with Hectospec as part of the same survey. Results. We find that star-forming cluster and field galaxies show similar median specific SFRs in a given mass bin of 1-3.2×10 10 M ⊙ and 3.2-10×10 10 M ⊙ , respectively. But their O/H values are displaced, in the lower mass bin, to higher values (significance 2.4$\sigma$) at projected radii of R{\textless} R 200 compared with galaxies at larger radii and in the field. The comparison with metallicity-SFR-mass model predictions with inflowing gas indicates a slow-quenching scenario in which strangulation is initiated when galaxies pass R∼R 200 by stopping the inflow of gas. We find tentative evidence that the metallicities of cluster members inside R 200 are thereby increasing, but their SFRs are hardly affected for a period of time because these galaxies consume available disk gas. We use the observed fraction of star-forming cluster galaxies as a function of clustercentric radius compared to predictions from the Millennium simulation to constrain quenching timescales to be 1-2 Gyr, which is defined as the time between the moment the galaxy passes R 200 until complete quenching of star formation. This is consistent with a slow-then-rapid quenching scenario. Slow quenching (strangulation) starts when the gas inflow is stopped when the galaxy passes R 200 with a phase in which cluster galaxies are still star forming, but they show elevated metallicities tracing the ongoing quenching. This phase lasts for 1-2 Gyr, and meanwhile the galaxies travel to denser inner regions of the cluster. This is followed by a "rapid" phase, i.e., a rapid complete quenching of star formation due to the increasing ram pressure toward the cluster center that can also strip the cold gas in massive galaxies.},

abstract = {Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a Lagrangian method for solving the fluid equations that is commonplace in astrophysics, prized for its natural adaptivity and stability. The choice of variable to smooth in SPH has been the topic of contention, with smoothed pressure (P-SPH) being introduced to reduce errors at contact discontinuities relative to smoothed density schemes. Smoothed pressure schemes produce excellent results in isolated hydrodynamics tests; in more complex situations however, especially when coupling to the ‘sub-grid' physics and multiple time-stepping used in many state-of-the-art astrophysics simulations, these schemes produce large force errors that can easily evade detection as they do not manifest as energy non-conservation. Here two scenarios are evaluated: the injection of energy into the fluid (common for stellar feedback) and radiative cooling. In the former scenario, force and energy conservation errors manifest (of the same order as the injected energy), and in the latter large force errors that change rapidly over a few timesteps lead to instability in the fluid (of the same order as the energy lost to cooling). Potential ways to remedy these issues are explored with solutions generally leading to large increases in computational cost. Schemes using a Density-based formulation do not create these instabilities and as such it is recommended that they are preferred over Pressure-based solutions when combined with an energy diffusion term to reduce errors at contact discontinuities.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that dwarf galaxies (107 {\textless} Mstellar {\textless} 109 M⊙, -12 {\textgreater} Mr {\textgreater} -18) with no active star formation are extremely rare ({\textless}0.06{\%}) in the field. Our sample is based on the NASA-Sloan Atlas which is a reanalysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8. We examine the relative number of quenched versus star-forming dwarf galaxies, defining quenched galaxies as having no H$\alpha$ emission (EWH$\alpha$ {\textless} 2 {\AA}) and a strong 4000 {\AA} break. The fraction of quenched dwarf galaxies decreases rapidly with increasing distance from a massive host, leveling off for distances beyond 1.5Mpc. We define galaxies beyond 1.5Mpc of a massive host galaxy to be in the field. We demonstrate that there is a stellar mass threshold of Mstellar {\textless} 1.0 × 109 M⊙ below which quenched galaxies do not exist in the field. Below this threshold, we find that none of the 2951 field dwarf galaxies are quenched; all field dwarf galaxies show evidence for recent star formation. Correcting for volume effects, this corresponds to a 1$\sigma$ upper limit on the quenched fraction of 0.06{\%}. In more dense environments, quenched galaxies account for 23{\%} of the dwarf population over the same stellar mass range. The majority of quenched dwarf galaxies (often classified as dwarf elliptical galaxies) are within 2 virial radii of a massive galaxy, and only a few percent of quenched dwarf galaxies exist beyond 4 virial radii. Thus, for galaxies with stellar mass less than 1.0 × 109 M⊙, ending star formation requires the presence of a more massive neighbor, providing a stringent constraint on models of star formation feedback. {\textcopyright} 2012.

Despite its cosmological nature, little h commonly appears in the measured properties of individual galaxies. This can pose unique challenges for users of such data, particularly with survey data. In this paper we show how little h arises in the measurement of galaxies, how to compare like-properties from different datasets that have assumed different little h cosmologies, and how to fairly compare theoretical data with observed data, where little h can manifest in vastly different ways. This last point is particularly important when observations are used to calibrate galaxy formation models, as calibrating with the wrong (or no) little h can lead to disastrous results when the model is later converted to the correct h cosmology. We argue that in this modern age little h is an anachronism, being one of least uncertain parameters in astrophysics, and we propose that observers and theorists instead treat this uncertainty like any other. We conclude with a "cheat sheet" of nine points that should be followed when dealing with little h in data analysis.},

abstract = {Gas-rich galaxies in dense environments such as galaxy clusters and massive groups are affected by a number of possible types of interactions with the cluster environment, which make their evolution radically different than that of field galaxies. The dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 1427A, presently infalling toward the core of the Fornax galaxy cluster for the first time, offers a unique opportunity to study those processes at a level of detail not possible to achieve for galaxies at higher redshifts, when galaxy-scale interactions were more common. Using the spatial resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys and auxiliary Very Large Telescope/FORS1 ground-based observations, we study the properties of the most recent episodes of star formation in this gas-rich galaxy, the only one of its type near the core of the Fornax cluster. We study the structural and photometric properties of young star cluster complexes in NGC 1427A, identifying 12 bright such complexes with exceptionally blue colors. The comparison of our broadband near-UV/optical photometry with simple stellar population models yields ages below years and stellar masses from a few 1000 up to , slightly dependent on the assumption of cluster metallicity and initial mass function. Their grouping is consistent with hierarchical and fractal star cluster formation. We use deep H$\alpha$ imaging data to determine the current star formation rate in NGC 1427A and estimate the ratio, $\Gamma$, of star formation occurring in these star cluster complexes to that in the entire galaxy. We find $\Gamma$ to be among the largest such values available in the literature, consistent with starburst galaxies. Thus a large fraction of the current star formation in NGC 1427A is occurring in star clusters, with the peculiar spatial arrangement of such complexes strongly hinting at the possibility that the starburst is being triggered by the passage of the galaxy through the cluster environment.},

abstract = {The distribution of the non-luminous matter in galaxies of different luminosity and Hubble type is much more than a proof of the existence of dark particles governing the structures of the Universe. Here, we will review the complex but well-ordered scenario of the properties of the dark halos also in relation with those of the baryonic components they host. Moreover, we will present a number of tight and unexpected correlations between selected properties of the dark and the luminous matter. Such entanglement evolves across the varying properties of the luminous component and it seems to unequivocally lead to a dark particle able to interact with the Standard Model particles over cosmological times. This review will also focus on whether we need a paradigm shift, from pure collisionless dark particles emerging from “first principles”, to particles that we can discover only by looking to how they have designed the structure of the galaxies.},

abstract = {(Abridged) Based on XMM-Newton, Chandra and SDSS data, we investigate the baryon distribution in groups and clusters and its use as a cosmological constraint. For this, we considered a sample of 123 systems, with total masses in the mass range M500 = {\~{}} 10{\^{}}13 - 4 x 10{\^{}}15 h{\_}70{\^{}}-1 Msun. The gas masses and total masses are derived from X-ray data under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry. The stellar masses are based on SDSS-DR8 data. For the 37 systems out of 123 that had both optical and X-ray data available, we investigated the gas, stellar and total baryon mass fractions inside r2500 and r500, and the differential gas mass fraction within the spherical annulus between r2500 and r500, as a function of total mass. For the other objects, we investigated the gas mass fraction only. We find that the gas mass fraction inside r2500 and r500 depends on the total mass. However, the differential gas mass fraction does not show any dependence on total mass for systems with M500 {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}14 Msun. We find that the total baryonic content increases with cluster mass. This led us to investigate the contribution of the ICL to the total baryon budget for lower mass systems, but we find that it cannot account for the difference observed. The gas mass fraction dependence on total mass observed for groups and clusters could be due to the difficulty of low-mass systems to retain gas inside the inner region. Due to their shallower potential well, non-thermal processes are more effective in expelling the gas from their central regions outwards. Since the differential gas mass fraction is nearly constant it provides better constraints for cosmology. Using our total f{\_}b estimates, our results imply 0.17 {\textless} Omega{\_}m {\textless} 0.55.},

abstract = {This paper describes the first catalogue of photometrically derived stellar mass estimates for intermediate-redshift (z {\textless} 0.65; median z= 0.2) galaxies in the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectroscopic redshift survey. These masses, as well as the full set of ancillary stellar population parameters, will be made public as part of GAMA data release 2. Although the GAMA database does include near-infrared (NIR) photometry, we show that the quality of our stellar population synthesis fits is significantly poorer when these NIR data are included. Further, for a large fraction of galaxies, the stellar population parameters inferred from the optical-plus-NIR photometry are formally inconsistent with those inferred from the optical data alone. This may indicate problems in our stellar population library, or NIR data issues, or both; these issues will be addressed for future versions of the catalogue. For now, we have chosen to base our stellar mass estimates on optical photometry only. In light of our decision to ignore the available NIR data, we examine how well stellar mass can be constrained based on optical data alone. We use generic properties of stellar population synthesis models to demonstrate that restframe colour alone is in principle a very good estimator of stellar mass-to-light ratio, M*/Li. Further, we use the observed relation between restframe (g-i) and M*/Li for real GAMA galaxies to argue that, modulo uncertainties in the stellar evolution models themselves, (g-i) colour can in practice be used to estimate M*/Li to an accuracy of ≲0.1 dex (1$\sigma$). This 'empirically calibrated' (g-i)-M*/Li relation offers a simple and transparent means for estimating galaxies' stellar masses based on minimal data, and so provides a solid basis for other surveys to compare their results to z≲0.4 measurements from GAMA. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

abstract = {2D stellar kinematics of 48 representative E and S0 galaxies obtained with the SAURON IFS reveal that early-type galaxies appear in two broad flavours, depending on whether they exhibit clear large-scale rotation or not. We define a new parameter LambdaR which involves luminosity weighted averages over the full 2D kinematic field, as a proxy to quantify the observed projected stellar angular momentum per unit mass. We use it as a basis for a new kinematic classification: early-type galaxies are separated into slow and fast rotators (SRs, FRs), depending on whether they have LambdaR values within their effective radius Re below or above 0.1, respectively. SRs and FRs are shown to be physically distinct classes of galaxies, a result which cannot simply be the consequence of a biased viewing angle. FRs tend to be relatively low luminosity galaxies. SRs tend to be brighter and more massive galaxies, but are still spread over a wide range of absolute magnitude. 3 slow rotators of our sample, among the most massive ones, are consistent with zero rotation. Remarkably, all other SRs contain a large kpc-scale KDC. All FRs show well aligned photometric and kinemetric axes, and small velocity twists, in contrast with most SRs which exhibit significant misalignments and velocity twists. In a companion paper (Paper X), we also show that FRs and SRs are distinct classes in terms of their orbital distribution. We suggest that gas is a key ingredient in the formation and evolution of FRs, and that the slowest rotators are the extreme evolutionary end point reached deep in gravitational potential wells where dissipationless mergers had a major role in the evolution, and for which most of the baryonic angular momentum was expelled outwards.

abstract = {Photographs enlarged to a common scale are given for 138 dwarf galaxies in the region of the Virgo cluster. Most are cluster members, as judged either from their uniquely low surface brightness and/or morphology, or occasionally from velocity data. All known Hubble galaxy types have been found in the Virgo cluster, ranging in absolute magnitude from the brightest known giant ellipticals and spirals to all the types of dwarfs that were expected from prior knowledge of the dE, Sm, Im, and blue compact dwarfs (BCD) in the Local Group and its environs. A new type of very large diameter (10000 pc), low central surface brightness ({\textgreater}25 B mag/arcsec) galaxy, that comes in both early (i.e., dE) and late (i.e., Im V) types, has been isolated, but there are, as yet, no known examples in the local neighborhood. The Atlas is organized in a way that recognizes the continuum between the giant and the dwarf ellipticals on the one hand, and the linear progression which, in order, connects the high luminosity Sc and Sd galaxies, the Magellanic Cloud Sm types, and the SMC Im galaxies of decreasing average surface brightness. This sequence among the late-type galaxies is one of ever-decreasing absolute luminosity. It is emphasized that, unlike the continuum that exists between giant and dwarf E galaxies, there are no connectives from the giant Sa, Sb, and Sc galaxies to a sequence of very-low-luminosity spirak. Dwarf Sa, Sb, and Sc galaxies (i.e., fainter than, say MB = - 17) are not present in the Virgo cluster, and we surmise that they do not exist. This Atlas and its descriptions are meant to form a preliminary classification system that organizes all known types of low-luminosity galaxies into a coherent scheme. It is also meant as a preliminary candidate list of late-type, low-SB dwarfs that can be usefully observed with Space Telescope to resolve the brightest stars in a next step to establish the extragalactic distance scale.},

abstract = {We study the implementation of mechanical feedback from supernovae (SNe) and stellar mass loss in galaxy simulations, within the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. We present the FIRE-2 algorithm for coupling mechanical feedback, which can be applied to any hydrodynamics method (e.g. fixed-grid, moving-mesh, and mesh-less methods), and black hole as well as stellar feedback. This algorithm ensures manifest conservation of mass, energy, and momentum, and avoids imprinting 'preferred directions' on the ejecta. We show that it is critical to incorporate both momentum and thermal energy of mechanical ejecta in a self-consistent manner, accounting for SNe cooling radii when they are not resolved. Using idealized simulations of single SN explosions, we show that the FIRE-2 algorithm, independent of resolution, reproduces converged solutions in both energy and momentum. In contrast, common 'fully thermal' (energy-dump) or 'fully kinetic' (particle-kicking) schemes in the literature depend strongly on resolution: when applied at mass resolution ≳100M⊙, they diverge by orders of magnitude from the converged solution. In galaxy-formation simulations, this divergence leads to orders-of-magnitude differences in galaxy properties, unless those models are adjusted in a resolution-dependent way. We show that all models that individually time-resolve SNe converge to the FIRE-2 solution at sufficiently high resolution ({\textless} 100M⊙). However, in both idealized single-SN simulations and cosmological galaxy-formation simulations, the FIRE-2 algorithm converges much faster than other sub-grid models without re-tuning parameters.},

abstract = {Exact computer arithmetic has a variety of uses, including the robust implementation of geometric algorithms. This article has three purposes. The first is to offer fast software-level algorithms for exact addition and multiplication of arbitrary precision floating-point values. The second is to propose a technique for adaptive precision arithmetic that can often speed these algorithms when one wishes to perform multiprecision calculations that do not always require exact arithmetic, but must satisfy some error bound. The third is to use these techniques to develop implementations of several common geometric calculations whose required degree of accuracy depends on their inputs. These robust geometric predicates are adaptive; their running time depends on the degree of uncertainty of the result, and is usually small. These algorithms work on computers whose floating-point arithmetic uses radix two and exact rounding, including machines complying with the IEEE 754 standard. The inputs to the predicates may be arbitrary single or double precision floating-point numbers. C code is publicly available for the 2D and 3D orientation and incircle tests, and robust Delaunay triangulation using these tests. Timings of the implementations demonstrate their effectiveness.},

@article{Arnaud2009,
abstract = {The space between the galaxies in clusters of galaxies is filled with a hot tenous gas. Its high temperature (0.5–15 keV) is set by the the virialization process in the cluster's deep potential well, and the gas emits in X-rays predominantly through thermal Bremsstrahlung. This intracluster medium (ICM) is the main baryonic components of clusters and accounts for about 10{\%} of the total dark matter dominated mass. While this is now well-established, it was not the case in the mid 70s, when the pioneer-ing paper by Cavaliere {\&} Fusco-Femiano (1976), which set the basis of the powerful $\beta$-model, was written. The idea of an ICM was proposed as early as 1959, but it took 10 years after its first detection in 1966 to definitively prove the existence of the hot ICM (see also Sarazin 1986; Biviano 2000, for a historical review). Limber (1959) stated that it is " rather likely that there is an appreciable quantity of intracluster gas pervading (...) clusters " , primordial gas left over from galaxy formation, gas swept out of galaxies during galaxy collisions, or both. However, " it (was) not at all clear at (that) time whether one should expect the intracluster gas to be hot or cold " . The first observational clue was the detection of M 87 in the Virgo clus-ter with the Geiger counters onboard an Aerobee rocket (Byram et al. 1966), which was also the first detection of an X-ray source associated with a cluster. The next major advance was made with Uhuru, the first satellite dedicated to X-ray astronomy, launched in 1970. Uhuru performed an all-sky X-ray survey and permit-ted longer observations of individual sources than with rockets experiments. This established that clusters are X-ray luminous sources and that the X-ray emission is extended and not time variable (e.g. Gursky et al. 1972, online). The detectors onboard Uhuru and rocket experiments were non-imaging proportional counters equipped with collimators to limit the field of view. Because of the crude spectral and spatial resolution (∼1 •) of the detectors, the origin of the X-ray emission was ambiguous. Three possibilities were considered: 1) thermal bremsstrahlung from a hot tenuous gas; 2) inverse Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons by relativistic electrons within the clusters; and 3) summed contributions of stellar sources (bina-ries or globular clusters). This was discussed very early by Felten et al. (1966) who correctly favored the thermal model on ener-getics arguments (unfortunately based on a spurious detection of the Coma cluster). In their paper, Cavaliere and Fusco-Femiano outlined several problems with the IC interpretation and, in particular, with the low value of the magnetic field implied by the ratio of the X-ray and Synchrotron radio luminosity. On the other hand, they em-phasized that the IC emission is expected to stand out at energies above the thermal emission's exponential cut-off, E ∼ {\textgreater} 10 keV. The IC emission was indeed searched later on as an excess over the thermal emission in the hard X-ray band with Beppo–SAX, RXTE, and now Suzaku. Its level remains uncertain, and the high magnetic field value generally inferred is still an issue. Cavaliere and Fusco-Femiano then focused on the thermal interpretation and proposed a model for the gas distribution that they com-pared successfully with the Uhuru observations of Coma. The thermal origin of the X-ray emission from clusters was defini-tively demonstrated shortly afterwards with the detection of the 7 keV iron line, first in the spectra of Perseus and Coma mea-sured with the OSO-8 and Ariel 5 satellites (Mitchell et al. 1976; Serlemitsos et al. 1977). The hot ICM model proposed by Cavaliere {\&} Fusco-Femiano (1976) was a major improvement over the model used previously by Lea et al. (1973) to fit the Coma, Perseus, and Virgo data. Lea et al. (1973) assumed that the gas was an isothermal self-gravitating plasma. This model was not consistent, since the derived gas mass was significantly lower than the bounding mass. Instead, Cavaliere and Fusco-Femiano assumed that the gas and the galaxies are in equilibrium in the same potential $\phi$(r). (As mentioned in the note added in proof, a similar model was considered independently by Lea 1975 and Gull {\&} Northover 1975.) A fundamental feature of the model is that the galaxy and gas radial distribution, $\rho$ gal and n gas , can then be directly related (their Eq. (1)) via the equilibrium equations: 1 n gas},

The majority of the galaxies are regular rotators, with eight hosting a kinematically distinct core. Only two galaxies are slow rotators. The mean age, total metallicity, and [Mg/Fe] abundance ratio in the bright central region inside 0.5 R e and in the galaxy outskirts are presented. Extended emission-line gas is detected in 13 galaxies, most of them are late-type objects with wide-spread star formation. The measured structural properties are analysed in relation to the galaxies' position in the projected phase space of the cluster. This shows that the Fornax cluster appears to consist of three main groups of galaxies inside the virial radius: the old core; a clump of galaxies, which is aligned with the local large-scale structure and was accreted soon after the formation of the core; and a group of galaxies that fell in more recently.},

abstract = {We examine the dark matter content of satellite galaxies in Lambda-CDM cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of the Local Group from the APOSTLE project. We find excellent agreement between simulation results and estimates for the 9 brightest Galactic dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) derived from their stellar velocity dispersions and half-light radii. Tidal stripping plays an important role by gradually removing dark matter from the outside in, affecting in particular fainter satellites and systems of larger-than-average size for their luminosity. Our models suggest that tides have significantly reduced the dark matter content of Can Ven I, Sextans, Carina, and Fornax, a prediction that may be tested by comparing them with field galaxies of matching luminosity and size. Uncertainties in observational estimates of the dark matter content of individual dwarfs have been underestimated in the past, at times substantially. We use our improved estimates to revisit the `too-big-to-fail' problem highlighted in earlier N-body work. We reinforce and extend our previous conclusion that the APOSTLE simulations show no sign of this problem. The resolution does not require `cores' in the dark mass profiles, but, rather, relies on revising assumptions and uncertainties in the interpretation of observational data and accounting for `baryon effects' in the theoretical modelling.},

abstract = {We use the EAGLE suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study how the HI content of present-day galaxies depends on their environment. We show that EAGLE reproduces observed HI mass-environment trends very well, while semi-analytic models typically overpredict the average HI masses in dense environments. The environmental processes act primarily as an on/off switch for the HI content of satellites withM* {\textgreater} 109M⊙. At a fixedM*, the fraction of HI-depleted satellites increase with increasing host halo mass M200 in response to stronger environmental effects, while at a fixedM200 it decreases with increasing satelliteM* as the gas is confined by deeper gravitational potentials. HI-depleted satellites reside mostly, but not exclusively, within the virial radius r200 of their host halo. We investigate the origin of these trends by focusing on three environmental mechanisms: ram pressure stripping by the intragroup medium, tidal stripping by the host halo and satellite-satellite encounters. By tracking back in time the evolution of the HI-depleted satellites, we find that the most common cause of HI removal is satellite encounters. The time-scale for HI removal is typically less than 0.5 Gyr. Tidal stripping occurs in haloes of M200 {\textless} 1014M⊙ within 0.5 × r200, while the other processes act also in more massive haloes, generally within r200. Conversely, we find that ram pressure stripping is the most common mechanism that disturbs the HI morphology of galaxies at redshift z = 0. This implies that HI removal due to satellite-satellite interactions occurs on shorter time-scales than the other processes.},

abstract = {We present the dynamical analysis of a sample of 12 dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies for which we have obtained SAURON large-scale two-dimensional spectroscopic data. We construct Jeans axisymmetric models and obtain total dynamical masses enclosed within one effective radius. We use the obtained values to show that the validity of the dynamical scaling relations of massive early-type galaxies can be extended to these low-mass systems, except that dEs seem to contain relatively larger fraction of dark matter in their inner parts. We then demonstrate that dE galaxies have lower angular momenta than the present-day analogues of their presumed late-type progenitors and we show that dE circular velocity curves are steeper than the rotation curves of galaxies with equal and up to an order of magnitude higher luminosity. This requires a transformation mechanism that is not only able to lower the angular momentum but also one that needs to account for increased stellar concentration. Additionally, we match the dark matter fraction of our galaxies to their location in the Virgo Cluster and see that galaxies in the cluster outskirts tend to have a higher dark-to-stellar matter ratio. Transformation due to tidal harassment is able to expain all of the above, unless the dE progenitors were already compact and had lower angular momenta at higher redshifts.},

abstract = {We perform high-resolution N-body+SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics) simulations of gas-rich dwarf galaxy satellites orbiting within a Milky Way-sized halo and study for the first time the combined effects of tides and ram pressure. The structure of the galaxy models and the orbital configurations are chosen in accordance with those expected in a Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) universe. While tidal stirring of disky dwarfs produces objects whose stellar structure and kinematics resembles that of dwarf spheroidals after a few orbits, ram pressure stripping is needed to entirely remove their gas component. Gravitational tides can aid ram pressure stripping by diminishing the overall potential of the dwarf, but tides also induce bar formation which funnels gas inwards making subsequent stripping more difficult. This inflow is particularly effective when the gas can cool radiatively. Assuming a low density of the hot Galactic corona consistent with observational constraints, dwarfs with can be completely stripped of their gas content on orbits with pericenters of 50 kpc or less. Instead, dwarfs with more massive dark haloes and lose most or all of their gas content only if a heating source keeps the gas extended, partially counteracting the bar-driven inflow. We show that the ionizing radiation from the cosmic ultraviolet (UV) background at can provide the required heating. In these objects, most of the gas is removed or becomes ionized at the first pericenter passage, explaining the early truncation of the star formation observed in Draco and Ursa Minor. Galaxies on orbits with larger pericenters andor falling into the Milky Way halo at lower redshift can retain significant amounts of the centrally concentrated gas. These dwarfs would continue to form stars over a longer period of time, especially close to pericenter passages, as observed in Fornax and other dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) of the Local Group. The stripped gas breaks up into individual clouds pressure confined by the outer gaseous medium that have masses, sizes and densities comparable to the H i clouds recently discovered around M31. {\textcopyright} 2006 RAS.},

abstract = {We present spatially resolved kinematics and global stellar populations and mass-to-light ratios for a sample of 39 dwarf early-type (dE) galaxies in the Virgo cluster studied as part of the SMAKCED stellar absorption-line spectroscopy and imaging survey. This sample is representative of the early-type population in the Virgo cluster in the absolute magnitude range -19.0 {\textless} M r {\textless} -16.0 and of all morphological subclasses found in this galaxy population. For each dE, we measure the rotation curve and velocity dispersion profile and fit an analytic function to the rotation curve. We study the significance of the departure of the rotation curve from the best-fit analytic function (poorly fit) and of the difference between the approaching and receding sides of the rotation curve (asymmetry). Our sample includes two dEs with kinematically decoupled cores that have been previously reported. We find that 62 ± 8{\%} (23 out of the 39) of the dEs have a significant anomaly in their rotation curve. Analysis of the images reveals photometric anomalies for most galaxies. However, there is no clear correlation between the significance of the photometric and kinematic anomalies. We measure age-sensitive (H$\beta$ and H $\gamma$A ) and metallicity sensitive (Fe4668 and Mgb) Lick spectral indices in the LIS-5 {\AA} system. This population of galaxies exhibits a wide range of ages and metallicities; we also find that 4 dEs show clear evidence of emission partially filling in the Balmer absorption lines. Finally, we estimate the total masses and dark matter fractions of the dEs and plot them in the mass-size, the mass-velocity dispersion, and the fundamental plane scaling relations. The dEs seem to be the bridge between massive early-type galaxies and dSphs, and have a median total mass within the R e of log M e = 9.1 ± 0.2 and a median dark matter fraction within the R e of f DM = 46 ± 18{\%}. Any formation model for the dE galaxy class must account for this diversity of kinematic and photometric anomalies and stellar populations.},

abstract = {We investigate the origin of the Hubble sequence by analysing the evolution of the kinematic morphologies of central galaxies in the EAGLE cosmological simulation. By separating each galaxy into disc and spheroidal stellar components and tracing their evolution along the merger tree, we find that the morphology of galaxies follows a common evolutionary trend. We distinguish three phases of galaxy formation. These phases are determined primarily by mass, rather than redshift. ForM* ≲ 109.5M⊙ galaxies growin a disorganizedway, resulting in a morphology that is dominated by random stellar motions. This phase is dominated by in situ star formation, partly triggered by mergers. In the mass range 109.5M⊙ ≲ M* ≲ 1010.5M⊙, galaxies evolve towards a disc-dominated morphology, driven by in situ star formation. The central spheroid (i.e. the bulge) at z = 0 consists mostly of stars that formed in situ, yet the formation of the bulge is to a large degree associated with mergers. Finally, atM* ≳ 1010.5M⊙ growth through in situ star formation slows down considerably and galaxies transform towards amore spheroidal morphology. This transformation is drivenmore by the build-up of spheroids than by the destruction of discs. Spheroid formation in these galaxies happens mostly by accretion at large radii of stars formed ex situ (i.e. the halo rather than the bulge).},

abstract = {Massive Primordial Black Holes (MPBH) can be formed after inflation due to broad peaks in the primordial curvature power spectrum that collapse gravitationally during the radiation era, to form clusters of black holes that merge and increase in mass after recombination, generating today a broad mass-spectrum of black holes with masses ranging from 0.01 to {\$}10{\^{}}5{\~{}}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. These MPBH could act as seeds for galaxies and quick-start structure formation, initiating reionization, forming galaxies at redshift {\$}z{\textgreater}10{\$} and clusters at {\$}z{\textgreater}1{\$}. They may also be the seeds on which SMBH and IMBH form, by accreting gas onto them and forming the centers of galaxies and quasars at high redshift. They form at rest with zero spin and have negligible cross-section with ordinary matter. If there are enough of these MPBH, they could constitute the bulk of the Dark Matter today. Such PBH could be responsible for the observed fluctuations in the CIB and X-ray backgrounds. MPBH could be directly detected by the gravitational waves emitted when they merge to form more massive black holes, as recently reported by LIGO. Their continuous merging since recombination could have generated a stochastic background of gravitational waves that could eventually be detected by LISA and PTA. MPBH may actually be responsible for the unidentified point sources seen by Fermi, Magic and Chandra. Furthermore, the ejection of stars from shallow potential wells like those of Dwarf Spheroidals (DSph), via the gravitational slingshot effect, could be due to MPBH, thus alleviating the substructure and too-big-to-fail problems of standard collisionless CDM. Their mass distribution peaks at a few tens of {\$}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} today, and could be detected also with long-duration microlensing events, as well as by the anomalous motion of stars in GAIA. Their presence as CDM in the Universe could be seen in the time-dilation of lensed images of quasars.},

abstract = {The spatial and velocity distributions of nuclear species synthesized in the innermost regions of core-collapse supernovae can yield important clues about explosion asymmetries and the operation of the still disputed explosion mechanism. Recent observations of radioactive {\$}{\^{}}{\{}44{\}}{\$}Ti with high-energy satellite telescopes (Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array [NuSTAR], INTEGRAL) have measured gamma-ray line details, which provide direct evidence of large-scale explosion asymmetries in SN 1987A and in Cassiopeia A (Cas A) even by mapping of the spatial brightness distribution (NuSTAR). Here we discuss a 3D simulation of a neutrino-driven explosion, using a parameterized neutrino engine, whose {\$}{\^{}}{\{}44{\}}{\$}Ti distribution is mostly concentrated in one hemisphere pointing opposite to the neutron star (NS) kick velocity. Both exhibit intriguing resemblance to the observed morphology of the Cas A remnant, although neither the progenitor nor the explosion was fine-tuned for a perfect match. Our results demonstrate that the asymmetries observed in this remnant can, in principle, be accounted for by a neutrino-driven explosion, and that the high {\$}{\^{}}{\{}44{\}}{\$}Ti abundance in Cas A may be explained without invoking rapid rotation or a jet-driven explosion, because neutrino-driven explosions generically eject large amounts of high-entropy matter. The recoil acceleration of the NS is connected to mass ejection asymmetries and is opposite to the direction of the stronger explosion, fully compatible with the gravitational tugboat mechanism. Our results also imply that Cas A and SN 1987A could possess similarly "one-sided" Ti and Fe asymmetries, with the difference that Cas A is viewed from a direction with large inclination angle to the NS motion, whereas the NS in SN 1987A should have a dominant velocity component pointing toward us.},

abstract = {We show that the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method, used with individual time steps in the way described in the literature, cannot handle strong explosion problems correctly. In the individual time-step scheme, particles determine their time steps essentially from a local Courant condition. Thus they cannot respond to a strong shock, if the pre-shock timescale is too long compared to the shock timescale. This problem is not severe in SPH simulations of galaxy formation with a temperature cutoff in the cooling function at 104 K, while it is very dangerous for simulations in which the multiphase nature of the interstellar medium under 104 K is taken into account. A solution for this problem is to introduce a time-step limiter which reduces the time step of a particle if it is too long compared to the time steps of its neighbor particles. Thus this kind of time-step constraint is essential for the correct treatment of explosions in high-resolution SPH simulations with individual time steps.},

abstract = {The observed central densities of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are significantly lower than the densities of the largest (Vmax ˜ 35 km s-1) subhaloes found in dissipationless simulations of Galaxy-size dark matter hosts. One possible explanation is that gas removal from feedback can lower core densities enough to match observations. We model the dynamical effects of supernova feedback through the use of a time-varying central potential in high-resolution, idealized numerical simulations and explore the resulting impact on the mass distributions of dwarf dark matter haloes. We find that in order to match the observed central masses of M⋆ ˜ 106 M⊙ dSphs, the energy equivalent of more than 40 000 supernovae must be delivered with 100 per cent efficiency directly to the dark matter. This energy requirement exceeds the number of supernovae that have ever exploded in most dSphs for typical initial mass functions. We also find that, per unit energy delivered and per cumulative mass removed from the galaxy, single blowout events are more effective than repeated small bursts in reducing central dark matter densities. We conclude that it is unlikely that supernova feedback alone can solve the `too-big-to-fail' problem for Milky Way subhaloes.},

Deep X-ray surveys like the CDF-S could have already detected these systems. Based on this, we provide upper limits for the z≥6z≥6 black hole mass density for both accretion models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nA photometric method to identify DCBH candidates in deep$\backslash$nmulti-wavelength surveys is developed: these sources are characterized by a steep spectrum in the infrared (1.6-4.5 $\mu$m), i.e. by very red colors. The method selects the only 2 objects with a robust X-ray detection found in the CANDELS/GOODS-S survey with z≥6. To date, the selected objects represent the most promising black hole seed candidates, possibly formed via the DCBH scenario, with predicted mass {\textgreater}10{\^{}}5 solar masses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFinally, we note that the abrupt collapse of a massive and rotating object such as a DCBH is a powerful source of gravitational waves emission.

abstract = {Positional, structural, and dynamical parameters for all dwarf galaxies in and around the Local Group are presented, and various aspects of our observational understanding of this volume-limited sample are discussed. Over 100 nearby galaxies that have distance estimates reliably placing them within 3Mpc of the Sun are identified. This distance threshold samples dwarfs in a large range of environments, from the satellite systems of the MW and M31, to the quasi-isolated dwarfs in the outer regions of the Local Group, to the numerous isolated galaxies that are found in its surroundings. It extends to, but does not include, the galaxies associated with the next nearest groups, such as Maffei, Sculptor, and IC 342. Our basic knowledge of this important galactic subset and their resolved stellar populations will continue to improve dramatically over the coming years with existing and future observational capabilities, and they will continue to provide the most detailed information available on numerous aspects of dwarf galaxy formation and evolution. Basic observational parameters, such as distances, velocities, magnitudes, mean metallicities, as well as structural and dynamical characteristics, are collated, homogenized (as far as possible), and presented in tables that will be continually updated to provide a convenient and current online resource. As well as discussing the provenance of the tabulated values and possible uncertainties affecting their usage, the membership and spatial extent of the MW sub-group, M31 sub-group, and the Local Group are explored. The morphological diversity of the entire sample and notable sub-groups is discussed, and timescales are derived for the Local Group members in the context of their orbital/interaction histories. The scaling relations and mean stellar metallicity trends defined by the dwarfs are presented, and the origin of a possible "floor" in central surface brightness (and, more speculatively, stellar mean metallicity) at faint magnitudes is considered. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {The numerical convergence of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) can be severely restricted by random force errors induced by particle disorder, especially in shear flows, which are ubiquitous in astrophysics. The increase in the number NH of neighbours when switching to more extended smoothing kernels at fixed resolution (using an appropriate definition for the SPH resolution scale) is insufficient to combat these errors. Consequently, trading resolution for better convergence is necessary, but for traditional smoothing kernels this option is limited by the pairing (or clumping) instability. Therefore, we investigate the suitability of the Wendland functions as smoothing kernels and compare them with the traditional B-splines. Linear stability analysis in three dimensions and test simulations demonstrate that the Wendland kernels avoid the pairing instability for all NH, despite having vanishing derivative at the origin (disproving traditional ideas about the origin of this instability; instead, we uncover a relation with the kernel Fourier transform and give an explanation in terms of the SPH density estimator). The Wendland kernels are computationally more convenient than the higher-order B-splines, allowing large NH and hence better numerical convergence (note that computational costs rise sub-linear with NH). Our analysis also shows that at low NH the quartic spline kernel with NH {\~{}}= 60 obtains much better convergence then the standard cubic spline.},

abstract = {The "too big to fail" problem is revisited by studying the tidal evolution of populations of dwarf satellites with different density profiles. The high resolution cosmological {\$}\backslashrm \backslashLambda CDM{\$} "ErisMod" set of simulations is used. These simulations can model both the stellar and dark matter components of the satellites, and their evolution under the action of the tides of a MW-sized host halo at a force resolution better than 10 pc. The stronger tidal mass loss and re-shaping of the mass distribution induced in satellites with {\$}\backslashgamma=0.6{\$} dark matter density distributions, as those resulting from the effect of feedback in hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxy formation, is sufficient to bring the circular velocity profiles in agreement with the kinematics of MW's dSphs. In contrast, in simulations in which the satellites retain cusps at {\$}z=0{\$} there are several "massive failures" with circular velocities in excess of the observational constraints. Various sources of deviations in the conventionally adopted relation between the circular velocity at the half light radius and the one dimensional line-of-sight velocity dispersions are found. Such deviations are caused by the response of circular velocity profiles to tidal effects, which also varies depending on the initially assumed inner density profile, and by the complexity of the stellar kinematics, which include residual rotation and anisotropy. In addition tidal effects naturally induce large deviations in the stellar mass-halo mass relation for halo masses below {\$}\backslashrm 10{\^{}}9 {\~{}} M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, preventing any reliable application of the abundance matching technique to dwarf galaxy satellites.},

The relation is remarkably tight with a scatter $\sigma$ {\~{}} 0.06 dex, or 14 per cent. The scatter does not change as a function of galaxy luminosity, H I richness or morphological type. The relation is linked to the fact that dwarf and spiral galaxies have a homogeneous radial profile of H I surface density in the outer regions when the radius is normalized by DHI. The early-type disc galaxies typically have shallower H I radial profiles, indicating a different gas accretion history. We argue that the process of atomic-to-molecular gas conversion or star formation cannot explain the tightness of the DHI-MHI relation. This simple relation puts strong constraints on simulation models for galaxy formation.},

We made use of the most widely adopted nucleosynthesis calculations and compared the model results with observational data with the aim of imposing constraints upon stellar yields. To best fit the data in the solar neighborhood, when adopting the Woosley {\&} Weaver (1995, ApJS, 101, 181) yields for massive stars and the Iwamoto et al. (1999, ApJS, 125, 439) ones for type Ia SNe, it is required that: i) the Mg yields should be increased in stars with masses from 11 to 20 M⊙ and decreased in masses larger than 20 M⊙. The Mg yield should be also increased in SNe Ia. ii) The Si yields should be slightly increased in stars above 40 M⊙, whereas those of Ti should be increased between 11 and 20 M⊙ and above 30 M⊙. iii) The Cr and Mn yields should be increased in stars with masses in the range 11-20 M⊙ iv) the Co yields in SNe Ia should be larger and smaller in stars in the range 11-20 M⊙ v) the Ni yield from type Ia SNe should be decreased; vi) the Zn yield from type Ia SNe should be increased. vii) The yields of O (metallicity dependent SN models), Ca, Fe, Ni, and Zn (the solar abundance case) in massive stars from Woosley {\&} Weaver (1995) are the best to fit the abundance patterns of these elements since they do not need any changes.

We also ran a simulation of a globular cluster with a tidal tail where we successfully recover the tails for a cluster at the same position and with the same characteristics of NGC 2298. Based on the simulation we estimate that the matched-filter increases the contrast of the tail relative to the background of stars by a factor of 2.5 for the case of NGC 2298. We also present the photometry of the globular cluster NGC 2298 using the MOSAIC2 camera installed on the Cerro Tololo International Observatory (CTIO) 4-m telescope.

A fit of a King profile to the radial density profile of NGC 2298 shows that this cluster has a tidal radius of which is twice as in the literature. The application of the matched-filter to NGC 2298 reveals several extra-tidal structures, including a leading and trailing tail. We also find that NGC 2298 has extra-tidal structures stretching towards and against the Galactic disc, suggesting strong tidal interaction. Finally, we assess how the matched-filter performs when applied to a globular cluster with and without mass segregation taken into account. We find that disregarding the effects of mass segregation may significantly reduce the detection limit of the matched-filter. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

abstract = {An Equation of State ($\backslash$textit{\{}EoS{\}}) closes the set of fluid equations. Although an ideal EoS with a constant $\backslash$textit{\{}adiabatic index{\}} {\$}\backslashGamma{\$} is the preferred choice due to its simplistic implementation, many astrophysical fluid simulations may benefit from a more sophisticated treatment that can account for diverse chemical processes. Here, we first review the basic thermodynamic principles of a gas mixture in terms of its thermal and caloric EoS by including effects like ionization, dissociation as well as temperature dependent degrees of freedom such as molecular vibrations and rotations. The formulation is revisited in the context of plasmas that are either in equilibrium conditions (local thermodynamic- or collisional excitation- equilibria) or described by non-equilibrium chemistry coupled to optically thin radiative cooling. We then present a numerical implementation of thermally ideal gases obeying a more general caloric EoS with non-constant adiabatic index in Godunov-type numerical schemes.We discuss the necessary modifications to the Riemann solver and to the conversion between total energy and pressure (or vice-versa) routinely invoked in Godunov-type schemes. We then present two different approaches for computing the EoS.The first one employs root-finder methods and it is best suited for EoS in analytical form. The second one leans on lookup table and interpolation and results in a more computationally efficient approach although care must be taken to ensure thermodynamic consistency. A number of selected benchmarks demonstrate that the employment of a non-ideal EoS can lead to important differences in the solution when the temperature range is {\$}500-10{\^{}}4{\$} K where dissociation and ionization occur. The implementation of selected EoS introduces additional computational costs although using lookup table methods can significantly reduce the overhead by a factor {\$}3\backslashsim 4{\$}.},

abstract = {We show results based on a large suite of N-Body/SPH simulations of isolated, flat dwarf galaxies, both rotating and non-rotating. The main goal is to investigate possible mechanisms to explain the observed dichotomy in radial stellar metallicity profiles of dwarf galaxies: dwarf irregulars (dIrr) and flat, rotating dwarf ellipticals (dE) generally possess flat metallicity profiles, while rounder and non-rotating dEs show strong negative metallicity gradients. These simulations show that flattening by rotation is key to reproducing the observed characteristics of flat dwarf galaxies, proving particularly efficient in erasing metallicity gradients. We propose a "centrifugal barrier mechanism" as an alternative to the previously suggested "fountain mechanism" for explaining the flat metallicity profiles of dIrrs and flat, rotating dEs. While only flattening the dark-matter halo has little influence, the addition of angular momentum slows down the infall of gas, so that star formation (SF) and the ensuing feedback are less centrally concentrated, occurring galaxy-wide. Additionally, this leads to more continuous SFHs by preventing large-scale oscillations in the SFR ("breathing"), and creates low density holes in the ISM, in agreement with observations of dIrrs. Our general conclusion is that rotation has a significant influence on the evolution and appearance of dwarf galaxies, and we suggest angular momentum as a second parameter (after galaxy mass as the dominant parameter) in dwarf galaxy evolution. Angular momentum differentiates between SF modes, making our fast rotating models qualitatively resemble dIrrs, which does not seem possible without rotation.},

The characteristic overdensity of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way which reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii, but are significantly shallower than {\$}r{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$} near the center and steeper than {\$}r{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$} near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies.},

@article{Wechsler2002,
abstract = {(abridged) We study the relation between the density profiles of dark matter halos and their mass assembly histories, using a statistical sample of halos in a high-resolution N-body simulation of the LCDM cosmology. For each halo at z=0, we identify its merger-history tree, and determine concentration parameters c{\_}vir for all progenitors, thus providing a structural merger tree for each halo. We fit the mass accretion histories by a universal function with one parameter, the formation epoch a{\_}c, defined when the log mass accretion rate dlogM/dloga falls below a critical value S. We find that late forming galaxies tend to be less concentrated, such that c{\_}vir ``observed'' at any epoch a{\_}o is strongly correlated with a{\_}c via c{\_}vir=c{\_}1*a{\_}o/a{\_}c. Scatter about this relation is mostly due to measurement errors in c{\_}v and a{\_}c, implying that the actual spread in c{\_}vir for halos of a given mass can be mostly attributed to scatter in a{\_}c. We demonstrate that this relation can also be used to predict the mass and redshift dependence of c{\_}v, and the scatter about the median c{\_}vir(M,z), using accretion histories derived from the Extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism, after adjusting for a constant offset between the formation times as predicted by EPS and as measured in the simulations;this new ingredient can thus be easily incorporated into semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. The correlation found between halo concentration and mass accretion rate suggests a physical interpretation: for high mass infall rates the central density is related to the background density; when the mass infall rate slows, the central density stays approximately constant and the halo concentration just grows as R{\_}vir. The tight correlation demonstrated here provides an essential new ingredient for galaxy formation modeling.},

I review the diversity of astrophysics simulation data formats commonly in use by researchers, providing an overview of the most common simulation techniques, including pure N-body dynamics, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), and unstructured meshes. Additionally, I highlight methods for incorporating physical phenomena that are important for astrophysics, including chemistry, magnetic fields, radiative transport, and "subgrid" recipes for important physics that cannot be directly resolved in a simulation. In addition to the numerical techniques, I also discuss the communities that have developed around these simulation codes and argue that increasing use and availability of open community codes has dramatically lowered the barrier to entry for novice simulators.},

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

We have undertaken a suite of simulations to investigate the tidal impact of the Milky Way on the chemodynamical evolution of dwarf spheroidals that resemble present day classical dwarfs using the SPH code GEAR. After simulating the models through a large parameter space of potential orbits, the resulting properties are compared with observations from a dynamical point of view, and from the, often neglected, chemical point of view. In general, we find that tidal effects quench the star formation even inside gas-endowed dwarfs. This quenching may produce the radial distribution of dwarf spheroidals from the orbits seen within large cosmological simulations. We also find that the metallicity gradient within a dwarf is gradually erased through tidal interactions as stellar orbits move to higher radii. The model dwarfs also shift to higher ⟨[Fe/H]⟩/L ratios, but only when they lose ≳20{\%} of stellar mass.},

abstract = {Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations are rich tools to understand the build-up of stellar mass and angular momentum in galaxies, but require some level of calibration to observations. We compare predictions at {\$}z\backslashsim0{\$} from the Eagle, Hydrangea, Horizon-AGN, and Magneticum simulations with IFS data from the SAMI Galaxy Survey, ATLAS-3D, CALIFA and MASSIVE surveys. The main goal of this work is to simultaneously compare structural, dynamical, and stellar population measurements. We have taken great care to ensure that our simulated measurements match the observational methods as closely as possible, and we construct samples that match the observed stellar mass distribution for the combined IFS sample. We find that the Eagle and Hydrangea simulations reproduce many galaxy relations but with some offsets at high stellar masses. There are moderate mismatches in {\$}R{\_}e{\$} (+), {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$} (-), {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}e{\$} (-), and mean stellar age (+), where a plus sign indicates that quantities are too high on average, and minus sign too low. The Horizon-AGN simulations qualitatively reproduce several galaxy relations, but there are a number of properties where we find a quantitative offset to observations. Massive galaxies are better matched to observations than galaxies at low and intermediate masses. Overall, we find mismatches in {\$}R{\_}e{\$} (+), {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$} (-), {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}e{\$} (-) and {\$}(V/\backslashsigma){\_}e{\$} (-). Magneticum matches observations well: this is the only simulation where we find ellipticities typical for disk galaxies, but there are moderate differences in {\$}R{\_}e{\$} (+), {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}e{\$} (-), {\$}(V/\backslashsigma){\_}e{\$} (-) and mean stellar age (+).

abstract = {In this review, we describe our current understanding of cluster formation: from the general picture of collapse from initial density fluctuations in an expanding Universe to detailed simulations of cluster formation including the effects of galaxy formation. We outline both the areas in which highly accurate predictions of theoretical models can be obtained and areas where predictions are uncertain due to uncertain physics of galaxy formation and feedback. The former includes the description of the structural properties of the dark matter halos hosting cluster, their mass function and clustering properties. Their study provides a foundation for cosmological applications of clusters and for testing the fundamental assumptions of the standard model of structure formation. The latter includes the description of the total gas and stellar fractions, the thermodynamical and non-thermal processes in the intracluster plasma. Their study serves as a testing ground for galaxy formation models and plasma physics. In this context, we identify a suitable radial range where the observed thermal properties of the intra-cluster plasma exhibit the most regular behavior and thus can be used to define robust observational proxies for the total cluster mass. We put particular emphasis on examining assumptions and limitations of the widely used self-similar model of clusters. Finally, we discuss the formation of clusters in non-standard cosmological models, such as non-Gaussian models for the initial density field and models with modified gravity, along with prospects for testing these alternative scenarios with large cluster surveys in the near future.},

abstract = {We use high-resolution N-body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of halo mass, of initial density fluctuation spectrum, and of the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fit over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation which reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results to previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, which allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

The sample consists of a wide variety of galaxy types, ranging from giant ellipticals to spiral galaxies and dwarfs, located in all (projected) areas of the cluster. It spans a mass range of 10∼8.5-11 M{\textperiodcentered}. The CO(1-0) line was targeted as a tracer for the cold molecular gas, along with the associated 3 mm continuum. CO was detected in 15 of the 30 galaxies observed. All 8 detected galaxies with stellar masses below 3 × 109 M{\textperiodcentered} have disturbed molecular gas reservoirs; only 7 galaxies are regular/undisturbed. This implies that Fornax is still a very active environment, having a significant impact on its members. Both detections and non-detections occur at all projected locations in the cluster. Based on visual inspection, and the detection of molecular gas tails in alignment with the direction of the cluster centre, in some cases ram pressure stripping is a possible candidate for disturbing the molecular gas morphologies and kinematics. Derived gas fractions in almost all galaxies are lower than expected for field objects with the same mass, especially for the galaxies with disturbed molecular gas, with differences of sometimes more than an order of magnitude. The detection of these disturbed molecular gas reservoirs reveals the importance of the cluster environment for even the tightly bound molecular gas phase.},

We identify two extreme cases that make this influence stand out most clearly: (i) merger trees with one massive progenitor that grows through relatively few mergers and (ii) merger trees with many small progenitors that merge only quite late. At a fixed halo mass, a type (i) tree tends to produce galaxies with larger stellar masses, larger half-light radii, lower central surface brightness, and since fewer potentially an- gular momentum cancelling mergers are required to build up the final galaxy, a higher specific angular momentum, compared with a type (ii) tree. We do not perform full-fledged cosmological simulations and therefore cannot hope to reproduce all observed properties of dwarf galaxies.

One particularly surprising thing about LIGO's discovery was that the gravitational waves were so strong that they had to have come from two black holes -- each of them 30 times heavier than the sun --  merging and producing more energy in gravitational waves than is emitted by all the stars in the universe. Think about that for a moment: each star is basically a massive nuclear fusion reactor, and the LIGO event was more energetic than all the stars in the universe combined.

abstract = {It is well known that galaxies falling into clusters can experience gas stripping due to ram-pressure by the intra-cluster medium (ICM). The most spectacular examples are galaxies with extended tails of optically-bright stripped material known as "jellyfish". We use the first large homogeneous compilation of jellyfish galaxies in clusters from the WINGS and OmegaWINGS surveys, and follow-up MUSE observations from the GASP MUSE programme to investigate the orbital histories of jellyfish galaxies in clusters and reconstruct their stripping history through position vs. velocity phase- space diagrams. We construct analytic models to define the regions in phase-space where ram-pressure stripping is at play. We then study the distribution of cluster galaxies in phase-space and find that jellyfish galaxies have on average higher peculiar velocities (and higher cluster velocity dispersion) than the overall population of cluster galaxies at all clustercentric radii, which is indicative of recent infall into the cluster and radial orbits. In particular, the jellyfish galaxies with the longest gas tails reside very near the cluster cores (in projection) and are moving at very high speeds, which coincides with the conditions of the most intense ram-pressure. We conclude that many of the jellyfish galaxies seen in clusters likely formed via fast ({\~{}}1- 2 Gyr), incremental, outside-in ram-pressure stripping during first infall into the cluster in highly radial orbits.},

This version contains a finite-volume magnetohydrodynamics algorithm on an unstructured, dynamic Voronoi tessellation coupled to a tree-particle-mesh algorithm for the Poisson equation either on a Newtonian or cosmologically expanding spacetime. Time-integration is performed adopting local timestep constraints for each cell individually, solving the fluxes only across active interfaces, and calculating gravitational forces only between active particles, using an operator-splitting approach. This allows simulations with high dynamic range to be performed efficiently. Arepo is a massively distributed-memory parallel code, using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) communication standard and employing a dynamical work-load and memory balancing scheme to allow optimal use of multi-node parallel computers. The employed parallelization algorithms of Arepo are deterministic and produce binary-identical results when re-run on the same machine and with the same number of MPI ranks. A simple primordial cooling and star formation model is included as an example of sub-resolution models commonly used in simulations of galaxy formation. Arepo also contains a suite of computationally inexpensive test problems, ranging from idealized tests for automated code verification to scaled-down versions of cosmological galaxy formation simulations, and is extensively documented in order to assist adoption of the code by new scientific users.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of star formation and feedback recipes appropriate for galactic smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. Using an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy, we constrain these recipes based on well-established observational results. Our star formation recipe is based on that of Katz (1992) with the additional inclusion of physically motivated supernova feedback recipes. We propose a new feedback recipe in which type II supernovae are modelled using an analytical treatment of blastwaves. With this feedback mechanism and a tuning of other star formation parameters, the star formation in our isolated Milky Way-like galaxy is constant and follows the slope and normalisation of the observed Schmidt law. In addition, we reproduce the low density cutoff and filamentary structure of star formation observed in disk galaxies. Our final recipe will enable better comparison of cosmological N-body simulations with observations.},

abstract = {We present a study of environmental effects and preprocessing in a large galaxy group using a high-resolution, zoom-in simulation run with the GASOLINE2 hydrodynamics code. We categorize galaxies that were always in distinct haloes as unaccreted, galaxies that were distinct before accretion onto the main group as single, and galaxies that were in external sub-groups before accretion onto the main group as grouped. The unaccreted galaxy population experiences steady growth in dark matter, gas and stellar mass. Both single- and group-accreted galaxies begin to lose dark matter and gas after first accretion onto any host but continue to grow in stellar mass. Individual trajectories show that galaxies cease mass growth within roughly three virial radii of the main group. Single galaxies continue to form stars until the group virial radius is crossed, when they begin to lose both dark matter and gas. Grouped galaxies peak in mass when joining their external sub-group, indicating that they experience preprocessing. Most accreted galaxies retain their accumulated stellar mass. The total mass loss is dominated by tidal stripping, with evidence for additional gas stripping via ram pressure. Most accreted galaxies are quenched {\$}\backslashsim{\$}(0.5-2.5) Gyr after accretion onto any group. These differing histories place unaccreted, single and grouped galaxies in distinct regions of the stellar mass-to-halo mass (SMHM) relation. This suggests that preprocessed galaxies are a key source of scatter in the SMHM relation for mixed galaxy populations.},

abstract = {We present a large sample of fully self-consistent hydrodynamical Nbody/Tree-SPH simulations of isolated dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). It has enabled us to identify the key physical parameters and mechanisms at the origin of the observed variety in the Local Group dSph properties. The initial total mass (gas + dark matter) of these galaxies is the main driver of their evolution. Star formation (SF) occurs in series of short bursts. In massive systems, the very short intervals between the SF peaks mimic a continuous star formation rate, while less massive systems exhibit well separated SF bursts, as identified observationally. The delay between the SF events is controlled by the gas cooling time dependence on galaxy mass. The observed global scaling relations, luminosity-mass and luminosity-metallicity, are reproduced with low scatter. We take advantage of the unprecedentedly large sample size and data homogeneity of the ESO Large Programme DART, and add to it a few independent studies, to constrain the star formation history of five Milky Way dSphs, Sextans, LeoII, Carina, Sculptor and Fornax. For the first time, [Mg/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] diagrams derived from high-resolution spectroscopy of hundreds of individual stars are confronted with model predictions. We find that the diversity in dSph properties may well result from intrinsic evolution. We note, however, that the presence of gas in the final state of our simulations, of the order of what is observed in dwarf irregulars, calls for removal by external processes. {\textcopyright} 2009 ESO.},

abstract = {By means of post-processed cosmological Hydrodynamics simulations we explore the ability of the fossil record method to recover the stellar mass, age gradients, and global/radial star formation and mass growth histories of galaxies observed with an optical Integral Field Unity. We use two simulations of representative Milky Way-sized galaxies, one disk dominated and another bulge-dominated. We generate data cubes emulating MaNGA/SDSS-IV instrumental and observational conditions, and analyze them using the Pipe3D pipeline. For optimal MaNGA instrumental/observational setups, the global masses, ages, and dust extinctions of both galaxies are well recovered within the uncertainties, while for the radial distributions, the trend is to get slightly flatter age gradients and weaker inside-out growth modes than the true ones. The main bias is in recovering younger stellar populations in the inner, older regions, and slightly older stellar populations in the outer, younger regions, as well as lower global stellar masses. These trends are enhanced as lower is the spatial sampling/resolution (less number of fibers), more inclined and dust-attenuated is the observed galaxy, lower is the signal-to-noise ratio, and worse is the seeing. The recovered properties and histories are more affected for the disk-dominated galaxy with a prominent inside-out growth mode than for the bulge-dominated galaxy assembled earlier and more coherently. We make publicly available the code and the mock IFU datacubes used in this paper.},

abstract = {Using high-resolution N-body simulations, we study the stellar properties of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies resulting from the tidally induced morphological transformation of disky dwarfs on a cosmologically motivated eccentric orbit around the Milky Way. The dwarf galaxy models initially consist of an exponential stellar disk embedded in an extended spherical dark matter halo. Depending on the initial orientation of the disk with respect to the orbital plane, different final configurations are obtained. The least evolved dwarf is triaxial and retains a significant amount of rotation. The more evolved dwarfs are prolate spheroids with little rotation. We show that in this scenario the final density distribution of stars can be approximated by a simple modification of the Plummer law. The kinematics of the dwarfs is significantly different depending on the line of sight which has important implications for mapping the observed stellar velocity dispersions of dwarfs to subhalo circular velocities. When the dwarfs are observed along the long axis, the measured velocity dispersion is higher and decreases faster with radius. In the case where rotation is significant, when viewed perpendicular to the long axis, the effect of minor axis rotation is detected, as expected for triaxial systems. We model the velocity dispersion profiles and rotation curves of the dwarfs under the assumption of constant mass-to-light ratio by solving the Jeans equations for spherical and axisymmetric systems and adjusting different sets of free parameters, including the total mass. We find that the mass is typically overestimated when the dwarf is seen along the long axis and underestimated when the observation is along the short or intermediate axis. For the studied cases, the effect of non-sphericity cannot, however, bias the inferred mass by more than 60{\%} in either direction, even for the most strongly stripped dwarf which is close to disruption.},

Here we use two different absolute calibration methods which yield an absolute distance to Fornax of 15.4 +/- 2.3 Mpc (absolute distance modulus of 30.94 +/- 0.33 mag).

abstract = {There is a growing consensus that the vast majority of ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs) are dwarf galaxies. However, there remain a few UDGs that seem to be special in terms of their globular cluster (GC) systems. In particular, according to some authors, certain UDGs exhibit large GC populations when compared to expectations from their stellar (or total) mass. Among these special UDGs, DF44 in the Coma cluster is one of the better-known examples. DF44 has been claimed to have a relatively high number of GCs, {\$}N{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{} GC{\}}{\}}=74{\^{}}{\{}+18{\}}{\_}{\{}-18{\}}{\$}, for a stellar mass of only {\$}3\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}8\backslash, \backslashmathrm{\{} M{\}}{\_}{\{} \backslashodot{\}}{\$} which would indicate a much larger dark halo mass than dwarfs of similar stellar mass. In this paper, we revisit this number and, contrary to previous results, find {\$}N{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{} GC{\}}{\}}=21{\^{}}{\{}+7{\}}{\_}{\{}-9{\}}{\$} assuming that the distribution of the GCs follows the same geometry as the galaxy. If we assume that the GCs around DF44 are distributed in a (projected) circularly symmetric way and, if we use a less strict criterion for the selection of the GCs, we find {\$}N{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{} GC{\}}{\}}=18{\^{}}{\{}+23{\}}{\_}{\{}-12{\}}{\$}. Making use of the MGC–Mhalo relation, this number of GCs suggests a dark matter halo mass of {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{} halo{\}}{\}}=1.1{\^{}}{\{}+0.4{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.5{\}} \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} \backslashmathrm{\{} M{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, a value which is consistent with the expected total mass for DF44 based on its velocity dispersion, {\$}\backslashsigma =33{\^{}}{\{}+3{\}}{\_}{\{}-3{\}}{\$} km s−1. We conclude that the number of GCs around DF44 is as expected for regular dwarf galaxies of similar stellar mass and DF44 is not extraordinary in this respect.},

A deep Chandra observation of ESO 137-001 allows us for the first time to examine the spatial and spectral properties of such X-ray tails in detail. Besides the known bright tail that extends to 80 kpc from ESO 137-001, a fainter and narrower secondary tail with a similar length was surprisingly revealed, as well as some intriguing substructures in the main tail. There is little temperature variation along both tails. The widths of the secondary tail and the greater part of the main tail also remain nearly constant with the distance from the galaxy. All these results challenge the current simulations. The Chandra data also reveal 19 X-ray point sources around the X-ray tails. We identified six X-ray point sources as candidates of intracluster ultra-luminous X-ray sources with L 0.3-10 keV of up to 2.5 × 1040 erg s-1. Gemini spectra of intracluster H II regions downstream of ESO 137-001 are also presented, as well as the velocity map of these H II regions that shows the imprint of ESO 137-001's disk rotation. For the first time, we unambiguously know that active star formation can happen in the cold interstellar medium (ISM) stripped by intracluster medium (ICM) ram pressure, and it may contribute a significant amount of the intracluster light. We also report the discovery of a 40 kpc X-ray tail of another late-type galaxy in A3627, ESO 137-002. Its X-ray tail seems hot, ∼2 keV (compared to ∼0.8 keV for ESO 137-001's tails). The H$\alpha$ data for ESO 137-002 are also presented. We conclude that the high-pressure environment around these two galaxies is important for their bright X-ray tails and the intracluster star formation. The soft X-ray tails can reveal a great deal of the thermal history of the stripped cold ISM in mixing with the hot ICM, which is discussed along with intracluster star formation. {\textcopyright} 2010.

In the latter period, previously separate issues involving missing mass were brought together in a single anomaly. We argue that reference to a straightforward 'accumulation of evidence' alone is inadequate to comprehend this episode. Rather, the rise of cosmological research, the accompanying renewed interest in the theory of relativity and changes in the manpower division of astronomy in the 1960s are key to understanding how dark matter came to matter.

abstract = {While the dark matter content within the most massive giant and smallest dwarf galaxies has been probed -- spanning a range of over one million in mass -- an important observational gap remains for galaxies of intermediate mass. This gap covers K band magnitudes of approximately -16 {\textgreater} M{\_}K {\textgreater} -18 (for which dwarf galaxies have B--K {\~{}} 2). On the high mass side of the gap are dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies, that are dominated by stars in their inner regions. While the low mass side includes dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies that are dark matter-dominated and ultra compact dwarf (UCD) objects that are star-dominated. Evolutionary pathways across the gap have been suggested but remain largely untested because the `gap' galaxies are faint, making dynamical measurements very challenging. With long exposures on the Keck telescope using the ESI instrument we have succeeded in bridging this gap by measuring the dynamical mass for five dwarf galaxies with M{\_}K {\~{}} -17.5 (M{\_}B {\~{}} --15.5). With the exception of our brightest dwarf galaxy, they possess relatively flat velocity dispersion profiles of around 20 km/s. By examining their 2D scaling relations and 3D fundamental manifold, we found that the sizes and velocity dispersions of these gap galaxies reveal continuous trends from dE to dSph galaxies. We conclude that low-luminosity dwarf elliptical galaxies are dominated by stars, not by dark matter, within their half light radii. This finding can be understood if internal feedback processes are operating most efficiently in gap galaxies, gravitationally heating the centrally-located dark matter to larger radii. Whereas external environmental processes, which can strip away stars, have a greater influence on dSph galaxies resulting in their higher dark matter fractions. Abridged.},

abstract = {The [Cii] 157.74 $\mu$m line is an important coolant for the neutral interstellar gas. Since [Cii] is the brightest spectral line for most galaxies, it is a potentially powerful tracer of star formation activity. In this paper, we present a calibration of the star formation rate (SFR) as a function of the [Cii] luminosity for a sample of 24 star-forming galaxies in the nearby Universe. This sample includes objects classified as Hii regions or low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions, but omits all Seyfert galaxies with a significant contribution from the active galactic nucleus to the mid-infrared photometry. In order to calibrate the SFR against the line luminosity, we rely on both Galaxy Evolution Explorer far-ultraviolet data, which is an ideal tracer of the unobscured star formation, and MIPS 24$\mu$m, to probe the dust-enshrouded fraction of star formation. In the case of normal star-forming galaxies, the [Cii] luminosity correlates well with the SFR. However, the extension of this relation to more quiescent (H$\alpha$ EW ≤ 10 {\AA}) or ultraluminous galaxies should be handled with caution, since these objects show a non-linearity in the -to-LFIR ratio as a function of LFIR (and thus, their star formation activity). We provide two possible explanations for the origin of the tight correlation between the [Cii] emission and the star formation activity on a global galaxy-scale. A first interpretation could be that the [Cii] emission from photodissociation regions (PDRs) arises from the immediate surroundings of star-forming regions. Since PDRs are neutral regions of warm dense gas at the boundaries between Hii regions and molecular clouds and they provide the bulk of [Cii] emission in most galaxies, we believe that a more or less constant contribution from these outer layers of photon-dominated molecular clumps to the [Cii] emission provides a straightforward explanation for this close link between the [Cii] luminosity and SFR. Alternatively, we consider the possibility that the [Cii] emission is associated with the cold interstellar medium, which advocates an indirect link with the star formation activity in a galaxy through the Schmidt law. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

abstract = {We compile a large sample of nearby galaxies that are satellites of hosts using a well known SDSS group catalogue. From this sample, we create an `ancient infallers' and `recent infallers' subsample, based on the mean infall time predicted from cosmological simulations for galaxies with their location in phase-space. We compare the stellar mass growth histories of the galaxies in these two subsamples, as determined from multi-wavelength SED fitting that uses a comprehensive library of star formation history shapes derived from cosmological simulations. By simultaneously controlling for satellite stellar mass and host halo mass, we can clearly see the impact of time spent in their hosts. As we might predict, the ancient infaller population shows clear signs of earlier quenching, especially for lower mass satellites in more massive hosts. More importantly, we find the effects are not limited to massive hosts. We find that hosts which might be considered low mass groups (halo masses {\$}\backslashsim{\$}10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}13{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}) can significantly alter their satellites, even for massive satellites (stellar masses {\$}\backslashsim{\$}10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}). Intriguingly, we see changes in the mass growth history of the satellites of clusters as early as 8 or 9 Gyr ago, when they had not yet entered the virial radius of their current host. We propose that this could be the result of galaxies being pre-processed in low-mass substructures in the protocluster outskirts, prior to infall.},

@article{Oey1997a,
abstract = {We use the standard, adiabatic shell evolution to predict the differential size distribution N (R) for populations of OB superbubbles in a uniform interstellar medium (ISM). Assuming that shell growth stalls upon pressure equilibrium with the ambient ISM, we derive N (R) for simple cases of superbubble creation rate and mechanical luminosity function (MLF). For constant creation and an MLF $\phi$(L) ∝ L-$\beta$, we find that N (R) ∝ R1-2$\beta$ for R {\textless} Re, and N (R) ∝ R4-5$\beta$ for R {\textgreater} Re, where the characteristic radius RE ∼ 1300 pc for typical ISM parameters. For R {\textless} Re, N (R) is dominated by stalled objects, while for R {\textgreater} Re it is dominated by growing objects. The relation N (R) ∝ R1-2$\beta$ appears to be quite robust, and also results from momentum-conserving shell evolution. We predict a peak in N (R) corresponding to individual supernova remnants (SNRs), and suggest that the contribution of Type la SNRs should be apparent in the observed form of N (R). We present expressions for the porosity parameters, Q2D and Q3D, derived from our analysis. Q2D is dominated by the largest superbubbles for $\beta$ {\textless} 2 and individual SNRs for $\beta$ {\textgreater} 2, whereas Q3D is normally dominated by the few largest shells. We examine evolutionary effects on the H II region luminosity function (H II LF), in order to estimate $\beta$. We find that for a nebular luminosity fading with time t, ℒ ∝ t-n, there is a minimum observed slope amin for the H II LFs. Empirical measurements all show a {\textgreater} amin, therefore implying that usually we may take $\beta$ = a. We also find that if nebular luminosity is instantaneously extinguished at some given age, rather than continuously fading, no amin will be observed. Comparison with the largely complete H I hole catalogue for the SMC shows surprising agreement in the predicted and observed slope of N (R). This suggests that no other fundamental process is needed to explain the size distribution of shells in the SMC. Further comparison with largely incomplete H I data for M31, M33 and Holmberg II also shows agreement in the slopes, but perhaps hinting at systematic differences between spiral and Im galaxies. We estimate porosities that are substantially {\textless} 1 for all of the galaxies except Holmberg II, for which we obtain values ≳ 1. Most of these galaxies therefore may not be strongly dominated by a hot interstellar component. However, porosity results for the Galaxy remain inconclusive with the available data. {\textcopyright} 1997 RAS.},

@article{Lisker2013,
abstract = {How did the dwarf galaxy population of present-day galaxy clusters form and grow over time? We address this question by analysing the history of dark matter subhaloes in the Millennium II cosmological simulation. A semi-analytic model serves as the link to observations. We argue that a reasonable analogue to early morphological types or red-sequence dwarf galaxies are those subhaloes that experienced strong mass-loss, or alternatively those that have spent a long time in massive haloes. This approach reproduces well the observed morphology- distance relation of dwarf galaxies in the Virgo and Coma clusters, and thus provides insight into their history. Over their lifetime, present-day late types have experienced an amount of environmental influence similar to what the progenitors of dwarf ellipticals had already experienced at redshifts above 2. Therefore, dwarf ellipticals are more likely to be a result of early and continuous environmental influence in group- and cluster-size haloes, rather than a recent transformation product. The observed morphological sequences of late-type and earlytype galaxies have developed in parallel, not consecutively. Consequently, the characteristics of today's late-type galaxies are not necessarily representative for the progenitors of today's dwarf ellipticals. Studies aiming to reproduce the present-day dwarf population thus need to start at early epochs, model the influence of various environments, and also take into account the evolution of the environments themselves. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

The lowest-mass UFDs are below surface brightness limits of current surveys but are potentially visible in next-generation surveys (e.g. LSST). The stellar metallicities are lower than in LG dwarfs; this may reflect pre-enrichment of the LG by the massive hosts or Pop-III stars.

For the first time, we compare how both self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) and/or warm dark matter (WDM) models affect the assembly histories as well as the central density structure in fully hydrodynamical simulations of dwarfs. Overall, the inclusion of self-interactions does little to affect the mass assembly of these halos (both dark matter and baryonic), while WDM models generally delay dark matter halo formation and reduce galaxies' stellar masses at {\$}z=0{\$}. Dwarfs with smaller stellar half-mass radii (r{\$}{\_}{\{}1/2{\}}{\textless}500{\$} pc) have lower {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}\backslashstar/V{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}max{\}}{\$} ratios, reinforcing the idea that smaller dwarfs may reside in halos that are more massive than is naively expected. Surprisingly, the majority of dwarfs simulated with self-interactions (regardless of the warmth of the dark matter) actually experience contraction of their inner density profiles with the addition of baryons relative to the cores produced in dark-matter-only runs, though the simulated dwarfs are always less centrally dense than in {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM.

@article{Rathi2020,
abstract = {Apparent deviations between properties of dwarf galaxies from observations and simulations are known to exist, such as the "Missing Dwarfs" problem, the too-big-to-fail problem, and the cusp-core problem, to name a few. Recent studies have shown that these issues can at least be partially resolved by taking into account the systematic differences between simulations and observations. This work aims to investigate and address any systematic differences affecting the comparison of simulations with observations. To this aim, we analyzed a set of 24 realistically simulated MoRIA (Models of Realistic dwarfs In Action) dwarf galaxies in an observationally motivated way. We first constructed "observed" color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of the simulated dwarf galaxies in the typically used V- and I-bands. Then we used the CMD-fitting method to recover their star-formation histories (SFHs) from their observed CMDs. These solved SFHs were then directly compared to the true SFHs from the simulation star-particle data, mainly in terms of the star-formation rate(SFR) and the age-metallicity relation (AMR). We applied a dust extinction prescription to the simulation data to produce observed CMDs affected by dust in star-formation regions. Since future facilities, such as the JWST and E-ELT will focus on the near IR rather than the optical, we also constructed and analyzed CMDs using the I- and H-bands. We find a very good agreement between the recovered and the true SFHs of all the simulated dwarf galaxies in our sample, from the synthetic CMD analysis of their V-I versus I as well as the I-H versus H CMDs. Dust leads to an underestimation of the SFR during the last few hundred million years. Overall, our analysis indicates that quantities like SFR and AMR derived from the photometric observations of galaxies are directly comparable to their simulated counterparts.},

abstract = {(abridged) Elliptical cluster galaxies moving through the ICM are successively stripped of their gaseous atmospheres. Deep X-ray observations reveal the detailed structure of galactic tails and wakes and of the interface between the galactic gas and the ICM. This fine-structure depends on dynamic conditions (galaxy potential, initial gas contents, orbit in the host cluster), stripping stage (early infall, pre-/post-pericenter passage), as well as on the still ill-constrained ICM plasma properties (thermal conductivity, viscosity, magnetic field structure). The first paper of this series describes flow patterns and stages of inviscid gas stripping. Here we study the effect of a Spitzer-like temperature dependent viscosity corresponding to Reynolds numbers, Re, of 50 to 5000 w.r.t. the ICM flow around the remnant atmosphere. Global flow patterns are independent of viscosity in this range. Viscosity suppresses Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHIs) at the sides of the remaining atmosphere and prevents mixing of cool stripped gas with the hotter ICM in the galaxy's wake. Thus, viscously stripped galaxies have long X-ray bright cool wakes. We provide a collection of mock X-ray images for different stripping stages and conditions. While these qualitative results are generic, we aim at the most direct comparison to observations and tailored our simulations to the Virgo elliptical galaxy M89 (NGC 4552), where Re {\~{}} 50 corresponds to a viscosity of 10{\%} of the Spitzer level. Paper III of this series compares in detail new deep Chandra and archival XMM-Newton data to our simulations. The comparison disfavors an isotropic viscosity near the Spitzer value in the Virgo ICM, and suggests a near pericenter position of M89 in the Virgo cluster.},

In this paper we carry out an analysis of their morphology, (B - I) colours and atomic hydrogen content. We compare these properties with those of dwarf galaxies in other environments to try and assess how the cluster environment has influenced their evolution. Field dwarfs are generally of a more irregular morphology, are bluer and contain relatively more gas. We assess the importance that various physical processes have on the evolution of cluster dwarf galaxies (ram-pressure stripping, tidal interactions, supernova-driven gas loss). We suggest that enhanced star formation triggered by tidal interactions is the major reason for the very different general properties of cluster dwarfs: they have undergone accelerated evolution. {\textcopyright} 2005 RAS.},

abstract = {This is an erratum for the paper “The Fornax Deep Survey (FDS) with VST VI. Optical properties of the dwarf galaxies in the Fornax cluster”. We noticed two mistakes in Fig. 21 of the original paper that have a slight effect on the shown ram pressure stripping radii, but do not change conclusions of that figure. In addition, in the original paper, we had calculated cluster-centric distances of objects incorrectly in some parts of our analysis, which slightly affects the appearance of several figures in the original paper. We show here the corrected versions of all the figures that were affected by this mistake. In this Letter, we use original numbering of the figures to avoid confusion. The conclusions and findings of the original paper are not altered by these mistakes. The first mistake in Fig. 21 of the original paper is that wrong velocities were used when estimating the stripping radii of the ram pressure stripping.

abstract = {Using traditional morphological classifications of galaxies in 10 intermediate-redshift (z{\~{}}0.5) clusters observed with WFPC-2 on the Hubble Space Telescope, we derive relations between morphology and local galaxy density similar to that found by Dressler for low-redshift clusters. Taken collectively, the `morphology-density' relationship, M-D, for these more distant, presumably younger clusters is qualitatively similar to that found for the local sample, but a detailed comparison shows two substantial differences: (1) For the clusters in our sample, the M-D relation is strong in centrally concentrated ``regular'' clusters, those with a strong correlation of radius and surface density, but nearly absent for clusters that are less concentrated and irregular, in contrast to the situation for low redshift clusters where a strong relation has been found for both. (2) In every cluster the fraction of elliptical galaxies is as large or larger than in low-redshift clusters, but the S0 fraction is 2-3 times smaller, with a proportional increase of the spiral fraction. Straightforward, though probably not unique, interpretations of these observations are (1) morphological segregation proceeds hierarchically, affecting richer, denser groups of galaxies earlier, and (2) the formation of elliptical galaxies predates the formation of rich clusters, and occurs instead in the loose-group phase or even earlier, but S0's are generated in large numbers only after cluster virialization.},

abstract = {The first paper in this series presented optical (UBVI) and near-infrared (H) surface photometry and H$\alpha$ Fabry-Perot interferometry of IC 4214, an excellent example of a multiringed galaxy with a weak bar. In the present paper, we analyze the nonaxisymmetric gravitational potential of IC 4214, as defined by the near-infrared data. The gas behavior is modeled with two-dimensional sticky particle simulations that employ a rigidly rotating nonaxisymmetric potential. Our goals are to interpret the morphology and velocity field of IC 4214 and to obtain a model from which the bar pattern speed, halo contribution, and relative bulge and disk masses can be deduced. We also study the orbital families in the derived IC 4214 model. A fairly good match, in both morphology and kinematics, is obtained for $\Omega$ bar ≈ 40 ± 5 km s -1 kpc -1 , placing the bar corotation slightly beyond the end of the bar (r bar /r cr ≈ 0.72 ± 0.05). The deduced bar amplitude implies that the visible mass of the disk dominates over the unseen halo (M disk /M halo {\textgreater} 3-4). Moreover, our model accounts quantitatively for the large difference in the orientation of IC 4214 as derived in our first paper with photometric and kinematic methods.},

abstract = {Modeling galaxy formation in a cosmological context presents one of the greatest challenges in astrophysics today, due to the vast range of scales and numerous physical processes involved. Here we review the current status of models that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxy formation: semi-analytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of the global and structural properties of galaxies from roughly Cosmic High Noon ({\$}z\backslashsim 2-3{\$}) to the present. Although minor discrepancies remain, overall, models show remarkable convergence between different methods and make predictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. Modelers seem to have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical for shaping galaxy properties. This core set includes cosmological accretion, strong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black hole feedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, and structural and morphological evolution through merging and environmental processes. However, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenological implementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned to observations. Many details of how these diverse processes interact within a hierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. Emerging multi-scale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar and cosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically grounded footing. Concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide new challenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraining inflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.},

In a metal-free environment, the main available coolants are H, He, H2 and HD; once the gas is enriched with metals, these also become important in defining the cooling properties of the gas. We discuss the implementation in gadget-2 of molecular and metal cooling at temperatures lower than 104 K, following the time-dependent properties of the gas and pollution from stellar evolution. We have checked the validity of our scheme by comparing the results of some test runs with previous calculations of cosmic abundance evolution and structure formation, finding excellent agreement. We have also investigated the relevance of molecule and metal cooling in some specific cases, finding that inclusion of HD cooling results in a higher clumping factor of the gas at high redshifts, while metal cooling at low temperatures can have a significant impact on the formation and evolution of cold objects. {\textcopyright} 2007 RAS.},

Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

This scenario is observationally motivated by the radial alignment of UDGs in Coma as well as the significant dependence of UDG abundance on cluster mass. As a test of this formation scenario, we apply a semi-analytic model describing the change in stellar mass and half-light radius of dwarf satellites, occupying either cored or cuspy halos, to cluster subhalos in the Illustris-dark simulation. Key to this model are results from simulations which indicate that galaxies in cored dark-matter halos expand significantly in response to tidal stripping and heating, whereas galaxies in cuspy halos experience limited size evolution. Our analysis indicates that a population of tidally-stripped dwarf galaxies, residing in cored halos (like those hosting low-surface brightness field dwarfs), is able to reproduce the observed sizes and stellar masses of UDGs in clusters remarkably well.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs) form stars at, for their sizes, extraordinarily high rates. In this paper, we study what triggers this starburst and what is the fate of the galaxy once its gas fuel is exhausted.We select four BCDs with smooth outer regions, indicating them as possible progenitors of dwarf elliptical galaxies. We have obtained photometric and spectroscopic data with the FORS and ISAAC instruments on the VLT. We analyse their infrared spectra using a full spectrum fitting technique, which yields the kinematics of their stars and ionized gas together with their stellar population characteristics. We find that the stellar velocity to velocity dispersion ratio (($\nu$/$\sigma$)*) of our BCDs is of the order of 1.5, similar to that of dwarf elliptical galaxies. Thus, those objects do not require significant (if any) loss of angular momentum to fade into early-type dwarfs. This finding is in discordance with previous studies, which however compared the stellar kinematics of dwarf elliptical galaxies with the gaseous kinematics of star-forming dwarfs. The stellar velocity fields of our objects are very disturbed and the star formation regions are often kinematically decoupled from the rest of the galaxy. These regions can be more or less metal rich with respect to the galactic body and sometimes they are long lived. These characteristics prevent us from pinpointing a unique trigger of the star formation, even within the same galaxy. Gas impacts, mergers, and in-spiraling gas clumps are all possible star formation igniters for our targets. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {The ionizing background determines the ionization balance and the thermodynamics of the cosmic gas. It is therefore a fundamental ingredient to theoretical and empirical studies of both the IGM and galaxy formation. We present here a new calculation of its spectrum that satisfies the empirical constraints we recently obtained by combining state-of-the-art luminosity functions and intergalactic opacity measurements. In our preferred model, star-forming galaxies and quasars each contribute substantially to the HI ionizing field at z{\textless}3, with galaxies rapidly overtaking quasars at higher redshifts as quasars become rarer. In addition to our fiducial model, we explore the physical dependences of the calculated background and clarify how recombination emission contributes to the ionization rates. We find that recombinations do not simply boost the ionization rates by the number of reemitted ionizing photons as many of these rapidly redshift below the ionization edges and have a distribution of energies. A simple analytic model that captures the main effects seen in our numerical radiative transfer calculations is given. Finally, we discuss the effects of HeII reionization by quasars on both the spectrum of the ionizing background and on the thermal history of the IGM. In regions that have yet to be reionized, the spectrum is expected to be almost completely suppressed immediately above 54.4 eV while a background of higher-energy ({\textgreater}{\~{}}0.5 keV) photons permeates the entire universe owing to the frequency-dependence of the photoionization cross section. We provide an analytic model of the heat input during HeII reionization and its effects on the temperature-density relation.},

abstract = {Most hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy cluster formation carried out to date have tried to model the cosmic gas as an ideal, inviscid fluid, where only a small amount of (unwanted) numerical viscosity is present, arising from practical limitations of the numerical method employed, and with a strength that depends on numerical resolution. However, the physical viscosity of the gas in hot galaxy clusters may in fact not be negligible, suggesting that a self-consistent treatment that accounts for the internal gas friction would be more appropriate. To allow such simulations using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method, we derive a novel SPH formulation of the Navier-Stokes and general heat transfer equations and implement them in the GADGET-2 code. We include both shear and bulk viscosity stress tensors, as well as saturation criteria that limit viscous stress transport where appropriate. Our scheme integrates consistently into the entropy and energy conserving formulation of SPH employed by the code. Using a number of simple hydrodynamical test problems, e.g. the flow of a viscous fluid through a pipe, we demonstrate the validity of our implementation. Adopting Braginskii parametrization for the shear viscosity of hot gaseous plasmas, we then study the influence of viscosity on the interplay between AGN-inflated bubbles and the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM). We find that certain bubble properties like morphology, maximum clustercentric radius reached or survival time depend quite sensitively on the assumed level of viscosity. Interestingly, the sound waves launched into the ICM by the bubble injection are damped by physical viscosity, establishing a non-local heating process. However, we find that the associated heating is rather weak due to the overall small energy content of the sound waves. Finally, we carry out cosmological simulations of galaxy cluster formation with a viscous ICM. We find that the presence of physical viscosity induces new modes of entropy generation, including a significant production of entropy in filamentary regions perpendicular to the direction of the clusters encounter. Viscosity also modifies the dynamics of mergers and the motion of substructures through the cluster atmosphere. Substructures are generally more efficiently stripped of their gas, leading to prominent long gaseous tails behind infalling massive haloes. {\textcopyright} 2006 RAS.},

abstract = {A review of the development of the concept of dark matter is given. I begin the review with the description of the discovery of the mass paradox in our Galaxy and in clusters of galaxies. In mid 1970s the amount of observational data was sufficient to suggest the presence of a massive and invisible population around galaxies and in clusters of galaxies. The nature of the dark population was not clear at that time, but the hypotheses of stellar as well as of gaseous nature of the new population had serious difficulties. These difficulties disappeared when non-baryonic nature of dark matter was suggested in early 1980s. In addition to the presence of Dark Matter, recent observations suggest the presence of Dark Energy, which together with Dark Matter and ordinary baryonic matter makes the total matter/energy density of the Universe equal to the critical cosmological density. There are various hypothesis as for the nature of the dark matter particles, and generally some form of weakly interactive massive particles (WIMPs) are strongly favored. Both Dark Matter and Dark Energy are the greatest challenges for modern physics since their nature is unknown.},

abstract = {Despite the common picture of an early-type dwarf galaxy (dE) as a quiescent galaxy with no star formation and little gas, we identify 23 dEs that have blue central colors caused by recent or ongoing star formation in our sample of 476 Virgo Cluster dEs. In addition, 14 objects that were mostly classified as (candidate) blue compact dwarfs have similar properties. Among the certain cluster members, the dEs with blue centers reach a fraction of more than 15{\%} of the dE population at brighter (mB{\textless}=16) magnitudes. A spectral analysis of the centers of 16 galaxies reveals in all cases an underlying old population that dominates the mass, with Mold{\textgreater}=90{\%} for all but one object. Therefore, the majority of these galaxies will appear like ordinary dEs within approximately one gigayear or less after the last episode of star formation. Their overall gas content is less than that of dwarf irregular galaxies but higher than that of ordinary dEs. Their flattening distribution suggests the shape of a thick disk, similar to what has been found for dEs with disk features in Paper I of this series. Their projected spatial distribution shows no central clustering, and their distribution with projected local density follows that of irregular galaxies, indicative of an unrelaxed population. This is corroborated by their velocity distribution, which displays two side peaks characteristic of recent infall. We discuss possible formation mechanisms (ram-pressure stripping, tidally induced star formation, and harassment) that might be able to explain both the disk shape and the central star formation of the dEs with blue centers.},

abstract = {Local galaxies are broadly divided into two main classes, star-forming (gas-rich) and quiescent (passive and gas-poor). The primary mechanism responsible for quenching star formation in galaxies and transforming them into quiescent and passive systems is still unclear. Sudden removal of gas through outflows or stripping is one of the mechanisms often proposed. An alternative mechanism is so-called "strangulation", in which the supply of cold gas to the galaxy is halted. Here we report an analysis of the stellar metallicity (the fraction of elements heavier than helium in stellar atmospheres) in local galaxies, from 26,000 spectra, that clearly reveals that strangulation is the primary mechanism responsible for quenching star formation, with a typical timescale of four billion years, at least for local galaxies with a stellar mass less than 10 11 solar masses. This result is further supported independently by the stellar age difference between quiescent and star-forming galaxies, which indicates that quiescent galaxies of less than 1011 solar masses are on average observed four billion years after quenching due to strangulation.},

abstract = {A numerical survey of the encounter history of the interacting grand-design system M51 (NGC 5194/5195) is performed with a 3D multiple spherical polar grid code, where both components of the pair are described with self-gravitating star + gas discs embedded in rigid analytical halo potentials. Two classes of models are investigated, (1) nearly parabolic single passages, and (2) bound encounters implying several disc-plane crossings. Both types of models can approximate the general morphology of the M51 system and simultaneously fit the projected velocity difference and separation of the components. In both cases the companion disc-plane crossing responsible for the main spiral structure occurred nearly in the south, about 400-500 Myr ago at a distance of 25-30 kpc, but in opposite directions. In the bound encounter model there is also a more recent crossing, at a distance of 20-25 kpc about 50-100 Myr ago. Our models account for some important kinematical observations of the M51 system not explained by the previous models. Especially, we note that the multiple-encounter model with a recent passage produces significant out-of-plane velocities, which manifest as an S-shaped structure of the major axis rotation curve, and which also explain the high peculiar velocities in the north of the companion. In this model the resulting extended tail is tilted 40°-50° with respect to the inner disc, leading to a velocity field that appears to suggest counter-rotation of the tail with respect to the inner disc. Also some morphological features, like the direction of the tidal extensions from the companion, are better matched by a model with a recent encounter. Importantly, any pre-existing spiral arms are washed out by the tidally triggered spiral arms. The multiple-encounter model assumes a high inclination (i ≈ 85°) orbit, with a low current eccentricity (∈ ≈ 0.2). The possible origin of this type of bound orbital configuration is studied by simulations including the orbital decay via the Chandrasekhar formula for dynamical friction, and also by simulations including a self-consistently modelled live halo for the primary. The gross features of the model, including the tilted far tail, are preserved even when allowing for the effects of several earlier passages. The observed well-defined far tail seems to suggest that the previous passages have been at least 30 per cent more distant than the latest two crossings. According to our limited orbital survey, such an orbital decay can be accounted for, provided that M51 has an extended dark halo containing at least a few times the mass within the visible disc region (total Mhalo/Mdisc ∼ 10).},

@article{Springel2002,
abstract = {We discuss differences in simulation results that arise between the use of either the thermal energy or the entropy as an independent variable in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). In this context, we derive a new version of SPH that, when appropriate, manifestly conserves both energy and entropy if smoothing lengths are allowed to adapt freely to the local mass resolution. To test various formulations of SPH, we consider point-like energy injection, as in certain models of supernova feedback, and find that powerful explosions are well represented by SPH even when the energy is deposited into a single particle, provided that the entropy equation is integrated. If the thermal energy is instead used as an independent variable, unphysical solutions can be obtained for this problem. We also examine the radiative cooling of gas spheres that collapse and virialize in isolation, and of haloes that form in cosmological simulations of structure formation. When applied to these problems, the thermal energy version of SPH leads to substantial overcooling in haloes that are resolved with up to a few thousand particles, while the entropy formulation is biased only moderately low for these haloes under the same circumstances. For objects resolved with much larger particle numbers, the two approaches yield consistent results. We trace the origin of the differences to systematic resolution effects in the outer parts of cooling flows. When the thermal energy equation is integrated and the resolution is low, the compressional heating of the gas in the inflow region is underestimated, violating entropy conservation and improperly accelerating cooling. The cumulative effect of this overcooling can be significant. In cosmological simulations of moderate size, we find that the fraction of baryons which cool and condense can be reduced by up to a factor {\~{}}2 if the entropy equation is employed rather than the thermal energy equation, partly explaining discrepancies with semi-analytic treatments of galaxy formation. We also demonstrate that the entropy method leads to a greatly reduced scatter in the density-temperature relation of the low-density Lyalpha forest relative to the thermal energy approach, in accord with theoretical expectations.},

abstract = {[Abrigded] We have started a new deep, multi-imaging survey of the Fornax cluster, dubbed Fornax Deep Survey (FDS), at the VLT Survey Telescope. In this paper we present the deep photometry inside two square degrees around the bright galaxy NGC1399 in the core of the cluster. We found a very extended and diffuse envelope surrounding the luminous galaxy NGC1399: we map the surface brightness out to 33 arcmin ({\~{}} 192 kpc) from the galaxy center and down to about 31 mag/arcsec{\^{}}2 in the g band. The deep photometry allows us to detect a faint stellar bridge in the intracluster region between NGC1399 and NGC1387. By analyzing the integrated colors of this feature, we argue that it could be due to the ongoing interaction between the two galaxies, where the outer envelope of NGC1387 on its east side is stripped away. By fitting the light profile, we found that it exists a physical break radius in the total light distribution at R=10 arcmin ({\~{}}58 kpc) that sets the transition region between the bright central galaxy and the outer exponential stellar halo. We discuss the main implications of this work on the build-up of the stellar halo at the center of the Fornax cluster. By comparing with the numerical simulations of the stellar halo formation for the most massive BCGs, we find that the observed stellar halo mass fraction is consistent with a halo formed through the multiple accretion of progenitors with a stellar mass in the range 10{\^{}}8 - 10{\^{}}11 M{\_}sun. This might suggest that the halo of NGC1399 has also gone through a major merging event. The absence of a significant number of luminous stellar streams and tidal tails out to 192 kpc suggests that the epoch of this strong interaction goes back to an early formation epoch. Therefore, differently from the Virgo cluster, the extended stellar halo around NGC1399 is characterised by a more diffuse and well-mixed component, including the ICL.},

abstract = {The ground-breaking detections of gravitational waves from black hole mergers by LIGO have rekindled interest in primordial black holes (PBHs) and the possibility of dark matter being composed of PBHs. It has been suggested that PBHs of tens of solar masses could serve as dark matter candidates. Recent analytical studies demonstrated that compact ultra-faint dwarf galaxies can serve as a sensitive test for the PBH dark matter hypothesis, since stars in such a halo-dominated system would be heated by the more massive PBHs, their present-day distribution can provide strong constraints on PBH mass. In this study, we further explore this scenario with more detailed calculations, using a combination of dynamical simulations and Bayesian inference methods. The joint evolution of stars and PBH dark matter is followed with a Fokker-Planck code PhaseFlow. We run a large suite of such simulations for different dark matter parameters, then use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to constrain the PBH properties with observations of ultra-faint galaxies. We find that two-body relaxation between the stars and PBH drives up the stellar core size, and increases the central stellar velocity dispersion. Using the observed half-light radius and velocity dispersion of stars in the compact ultra-faint dwarf galaxies as joint constraints, we infer that these dwarfs may have a cored dark matter halo with the central density in the range of 1-2 {\$}\backslashrm{\{}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}/pc{\^{}}3{\}}{\$}, and that the PBHs may have a mass range of 2-14 {\$}\backslashrm{\{}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\}}{\$} if they constitute all or a substantial fraction of the dark matter.},

abstract = {We introduce the LYRA project, a new high resolution galaxy formation model built within the framework of the cosmological hydro-dynamical moving mesh code arepo. The model resolves the multi-phase interstellar medium down to 10 K. It forms individual stars sampled from the initial mass function (IMF), and tracks their lifetimes and death pathways individually. Single supernova (SN) blast waves with variable energy are followed within the hydrodynamic calculation to interact with the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). In this paper, we present the methods and apply the model to a 1010 M isolated halo. We demonstrate that the majority of supernovae are Sedov-resolved at our fiducial gas mass resolution of 4 M. We show that our SN feedback prescription self-consistently produces a hot phase within the ISM that drives significant outflows, reduces the gas density and suppresses star formation. Clustered SN play a major role in enhancing the effectiveness of feedback, because the majority of explosions occur in low density material. Accounting for variable SN energy affects the metallicity distribution function by altering the efficiency of metal mixing. Additionally, it alters the outflow behaviour, reducing the mass loading by a factor of 2 − 3 with respect to fixed energy models, thus allowing the galaxy to retain a higher fraction of mass and metals. LYRA makes it possible to use a comprehensive multiphysics ISM model directly in cosmological (zoom) simulations of dwarf and higher mass galaxies.},

abstract = {Using galaxy group/cluster catalogs created from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, we examine in detail the specific star formation rate (SSFR) distribution of satellite galaxies and its dependence on stellar mass, host halo mass, and halo-centric radius. All galaxies, regardless of central-satellite designation, exhibit a similar bimodal SSFR distribution, with a strong break at SSFR {\~{}} 10{\^{}}-11 yr{\^{}}-1 and the same high SSFR peak; in no regime is there ever an excess of galaxies in the `green valley'. Satellite galaxies are simply more likely to lie on the quenched (`red sequence') side of the SSFR distribution. Furthermore, the satellite quenched fraction excess above the field galaxy value is nearly independent of galaxy stellar mass. An enhanced quenched fraction for satellites persists in groups with halo masses down to 3 x 10{\^{}}11 Msol and increases strongly with halo mass and toward halo center. We find no detectable quenching enhancement for galaxies beyond {\~{}}2R{\_}vir around massive clusters once these galaxies have been decomposed into centrals and satellites. These trends imply that (1) galaxies experience no significant environmental effects until they cross within {\~{}}R{\_}vir of a more massive host halo, (2) after this, star formation in active satellites continues to evolve in the same manner as active central galaxies for several Gyrs, and (3) once begun, satellite star formation quenching occurs rapidly. These results place strong constraints on satellite-specific quenching mechanisms, as we will discuss further in companion papers.},

abstract = {Ever deeper and wider lookback surveys have led to a fairly robust outline of the cosmic star-formation history, which culminated around z∼2; this period is often nicknamed “cosmic noon.” Our knowledge about star-forming galaxies at these epochs has dramatically advanced from increasingly complete population censuses and detailed views of individual galaxies. We highlight some of the key observational insights that influenced our current understanding of galaxy evolution in the equilibrium growth picture: ▪ Scaling relations between galaxy properties are fairly well established among massive galaxies at least out to z∼2, pointing to regulating mechanisms already acting on galaxy growth. ▪ Resolved views reveal that gravitational instabilities and efficient secular processes within the gas- and baryon-rich galaxies at z∼2 play an important role in the early buildup of galactic structure. ▪ Ever more sensitive observations of kinematics at z∼2 are probing the baryon and dark matter budget on galactic scales and the links between star-forming galaxies and their likely descendants. ▪ Toward higher masses, massive bulges, dense cores, and powerful AGN and AGN-driven outflows are more prevalent and likely play a role in quenching star formation.We outline emerging questions and exciting prospects for the next decade with upcoming instrumentation, including the James Webb Space Telescope and the next generation of extremely large telescopes.Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Volume 58 is August 18, 2020.

abstract = {It has been known for half a century that the interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy is structured on scales as small as a few hundred kilometers, more than 10 orders of magnitude smaller than typical ISM structures and energy input scales. In this review we focus on neutral and ionized structures on spatial scales of a few to ∼10 4 AU, which appear to be highly overpressured, as these have the most important role in the dynamics and energy balance of interstellar gas: the tiny scale atomic structures (TSASs) and extreme scattering events (ESEs) as the most overpressured example of the tiny scale ionized structures (TSISs). We review observational results and highlight key physical processes at AU scales. We present evidence for and against microstructures as part of a universal turbulent cascade and as discrete structures, and we review their association with supernova remnants, the Local Bubble, and bright stars. We suggest a number of observational and theoretical programs that could clarify the nature of AU structures. TSAS and TSIS probe spatial scales in the range of what is expected for turbulent dissipation scales and are therefore of key importance for constraining exotic and not-well-understood physical processes that have implications for many areas of astrophysics. The emerging picture is one in which a magnetized, turbulent cascade, driven hard by a local energy source and acting jointly with phenomena such as thermal instability, is the source of these microstructures.},

abstract = {We use the standard, adiabatic shell evolution to predict the differential size distribution N(R) for populations of OB superbubbles in a uniform ISM. Assuming that shell growth stalls upon pressure equilibrium with the ambient ISM, and that all shells have the same lifetime t{\_}e, we derive N(R) for simple cases of superbubble creation rate and mechanical luminosity function (MLF). For constant creation and an MLF phi(L) {\~{}} L{\^{}}{\{}-beta{\}}, we find that N(R) {\~{}} R{\^{}}{\{}1-2 beta{\}} for R {\textless} R{\_}e, and N(R) {\~{}} R{\^{}}{\{}4-5 beta{\}} for R {\textgreater} R{\_}e, where the characteristic radius R{\_}e {\~{}} 1300 pc is the stall radius associated with t{\_}e. For R {\textless} R{\_}e, N(R) is dominated by stalled objects, while for R {\textgreater} R{\_}e it is dominated by growing objects. The relation N(R) {\~{}} R{\^{}}{\{}1-2$\backslash$beta{\}} appears to be quite robust, and also results from the momentum-conserving shell evolution. We predict a peak in N(R) corresponding to individual SNRs, and suggest that the contribution of Type Ia SNRs should be apparent in the observed form of N(R). We present expressions for the porosity parameters, Q{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2D{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and Q{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}3D{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, derived from our analysis. Q{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2D{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is dominated by the largest superbubbles for beta {\textless} 2 and individual SNRs for beta {\textgreater} 2, whereas Q{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}3D{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is normally dominated by the few largest shells. We examine evolutionary effects on the HII region luminosity function (HII LF), in order to estimate beta. If the nebular luminosity {\{}$\backslash$Lha{\}} fades too quickly, the observed slope a of the HII LF will be steepened, since bright objects are quickly diminished. We find that for a nebular fading {\{}$\backslash$Lha{\}} {\~{}} t{\^{}}{\{}-eta{\}}, there is a minimum observed slope a{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}min{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} for the HII LFs, describing the relative importance of this effect. Empirical measurements all show a {\textgreater} a{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}min{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, therefore implying that usually we may take $\backslash$beta = a. We also find that if nebular luminosity is instantaneously extinguished at some given age, rather than continuously fading, no a{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}min{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} will be observed. Comparison with the largely complete HI hole catalog for the SMC shows surprising agreement in the predicted and observed slope of N(R). This suggests that no other fundamental process is needed to explain the size distribution of shells in the SMC. Further comparison with largely incomplete HI data for M31, M33, and Holmberg II also shows agreement in the slopes, but perhaps hinting at systematic differences between spiral and Im galaxies. We estimate porosities that are substantially {\textless} 1 for all of the galaxies except Holmberg II, for which we obtain values {\textgreater}{\~{}} 1. Most of these galaxies therefore may not be strongly dominated by a hot interstellar component. However, porosity results for the Galaxy remain inconclusive with the available data.},

abstract = {Voronoi grids have been successfully used to represent density structures of gas in astronomical hydrodynamics simulations. While some codes are explicitly built around using a Voronoi grid, others, such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), use particle-based representations and can benefit from constructing a Voronoi grid for post-processing their output. So far, calculating the density of each Voronoi cell from SPH data has been done numerically, which is both slow and potentially inaccurate. This paper proposes an alternative analytic method, which is fast and accurate. We derive an expression for the integral of a cubic spline kernel over the volume of a Voronoi cell and link it to the density of the cell. Mass conservation is ensured rigorously by the procedure. The method can be applied more broadly to integrate a spherically symmetric polynomial function over the volume of a random polyhedron.},

abstract = {Star formation lies at the center of a web of processes that drive cosmic evolution: generation of radiant energy, synthesis of elements, formation of planets, and development of life. Decades of observations have yielded a variety of empirical rules about how it operates, but at present we have no comprehensive, quantitative theory. In this review I discuss the current state of the field of star formation, focusing on three central questions: what controls the rate at which gas in a galaxy converts to stars? What determines how those stars are clustered, and what fraction of the stellar population ends up in gravitationally-bound structures? What determines the stellar initial mass function, and does it vary with star-forming environment? I use these three question as a lens to introduce the basics of star formation, beginning with a review of the observational phenomenology and the basic physical processes. I then review the status of current theories that attempt to solve each of the three problems, pointing out links between them and opportunities for theoretical and numerical work that crosses the scale between them. I conclude with a discussion of prospects for theoretical progress in the coming years.},

abstract = {We investigate the dependence of dark matter halo clustering on halo formation time, density profile concentration, and subhalo occupation number, using high-resolution numerical simulations of a LCDM cosmology. We confirm results that halo clustering is a function of halo formation time, and that this trend depends on halo mass. For the first time, we show unequivocally that halo clustering is a function of halo concentration and show that the dependence of halo bias on concentration, mass, and redshift can be accurately parameterized in a simple way: b(c,M|z) = b(M|z) b(c|M/M*). The scaling between bias and concentration changes sign with the value of M/M*: high concentration (early forming) objects cluster more strongly for M {\textless}{\~{}} M* while low concentration (late forming) objects cluster more strongly for rare high-mass halos, M {\textgreater}{\~{}} M*. We show the first explicit demonstration that host dark halo clustering depends on the halo occupation number (of dark matter subhalos) and discuss implications for halo model calculations of dark matter power spectra and galaxy clustering statistics. The effect of these halo properties on clustering is strongest for early-forming dwarf-mass halos, which are significantly more clustered than typical halos of their mass. Our results suggest that isolated low-mass galaxies (e.g. low surface-brightness dwarfs) should have more slowly-rising rotation curves than their clustered counterparts, and may have consequences for the dearth of dwarf galaxies in voids. They also imply that self calibrating richness-selected cluster samples with their clustering properties might overestimate cluster masses and bias cosmological parameter estimation.},

abstract = {We conduct a comprehensive numerical study of the orbital dependence of harassment on earlytype dwarfs consisting of 168 different orbits within a realistic, Virgo-like cluster, varying in eccentricity and pericentre distance. We find harassment is only effective at stripping stars or truncating their stellar discs for orbits that enter deep into the cluster core. Comparing to the orbital distribution in cosmological simulations, we find that the majority of the orbits (more than three quarters) result in no stellar mass loss. We also study the effects on the radial profiles of the globular cluster systems of early-type dwarfs. We find these are significantly altered only if harassment is very strong. This suggests that perhaps most early-type dwarfs in clusters such as Virgo have not suffered any tidal stripping of stars or globular clusters due to harassment, as these components are safely embedded deep within their dark matter halo. We demonstrate that this result is actually consistent with an earlier study of harassment of dwarf galaxies, despite the apparent contradiction. Those few dwarf models that do suffer stellar stripping are found out to the virial radius of the cluster at redshift = 0, which mixes them in with less strongly harassed galaxies. However when placed on phase-space diagrams, strongly harassed galaxies are found offset to lower velocities compared to weakly harassed galaxies. This remains true in a cosmological simulation, even when haloes have a wide range of masses and concentrations. Thus phase-space diagrams may be a useful tool for determining the relative likelihood that galaxies have been strongly or weakly harassed.},

As a first application, we apply our method to the ‘ultra-faint' dwarf Eridanus II (Eri II) that has a lone star cluster ∼45 pc from its centre. Using a grid of collisional N-body simulations, incorporating the effects of stellar evolution, external tides and dynamical friction, we show that a DM core for Eri II naturally reproduces the size and the projected position of its star cluster. By contrast, a dense cusped galaxy requires the cluster to lie implausibly far from the centre of Eri II ({\textgreater}1 kpc), with a high inclination orbit that must be observed at a particular orbital phase. Our results, therefore, favour a DM core. This implies that either a cold DM cusp was ‘heated up' at the centre of Eri II by bursty star formation or we are seeing an evidence for physics beyond cold DM.},

Exploiting the data from the GAs Stripping Phenomena in galaxies with MUSE (GASP), we provide the first characterisation of the spatially resolved properties of galaxies embedded in filaments in the local Universe. The four galaxies we focus on show peculiar ionised gas distributions: Halpha clouds have been observed beyond four times the effective radius. The gas kinematics, metallicity map and the ratios of emission line fluxes confirm that they do belong to the galaxy gas disk, the analysis of their spectra shows that very weak stellar continuum is associated to them. Similarly, the star formation history and luminosity weighted age maps point to a recent formation of such clouds. The clouds are powered by star formation, and are characterised by intermediate values of dust absorption. We hypothesise a scenario in which the observed features are due to "Cosmic Web Enhancement": we are most likely witnessing galaxies passing through or flowing within filaments that assist the gas cooling and increase the extent of the star formation in the densest regions in the circumgalactic gas. Targeted simulations are mandatory to better understand this phenomenon.},

With previous data from our High-Z Supernova Search Team, this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the Hubble constant (H{\_}0), the mass density (Omega{\_}M), the cosmological constant (Omega{\_}Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q{\_}0), and the dynamical age of the Universe (t{\_}0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10{\%} to 15{\%} farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega{\_}M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater} 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q{\_}0 {\textless} 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega{\_}M {\textgreater} 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q{\_}0 {\textless}0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega{\_}M=0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega{\_}Lambda{\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior (Omega{\_}M+Omega{\_}Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater}0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega{\_}M=1) is ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects reconciles the data with Omega{\_}Lambda=0 and q{\_}0 {\textgreater} 0.},

We start by introducing the basic ideas and concepts and thereby outline all ingredients that are necessary for a practical implementation of the method in a working SPH code. Much of SPH's success relies on its excellent conservation properties and therefore the numerical conservation of physical invariants receives much attention throughout this review. The self-consistent derivation of the SPH equations from the Lagrangian of an ideal fluid is the common theme of the remainder of the text. We derive a modern, Newtonian SPH formulation from the Lagrangian of an ideal fluid. It accounts for changes of the local resolution lengths which result in corrective, so-called “grad-h-terms”. We extend this strategy to special relativity for which we derive the corresponding grad-h equation set. The variational approach is further applied to a general-relativistic fluid evolving in a fixed, curved background space-time. Particular care is taken to explicitly derive all relevant equations in a coherent way.},

abstract = {I present a comprehensive review of the evolution of galaxy structure in the universe from the first galaxies we can currently observe at z{\~{}}6 down to galaxies we see in the local universe. I further address how these changes reveal galaxy formation processes that galaxy structural analyses can provide. This review is pedagogical and begins with a detailed discussion of the major methods in which galaxies are studied morphologically and structurally. This includes the well-established visual method; Sersic fitting to measure galaxy sizes and surface brightness profile shapes; non-parametric structural methods including the concentration (C), asymmetry (A), clumpiness (S) (CAS) method, as well as newer structural indices. Included is a discussion of how these structural indices measure fundamental properties of galaxies such as their scale, star formation rate, and ongoing merger activity. Extensive observational results are shown demonstrating how broad galaxy morphologies and structures change with time up to z{\~{}}3, from small, compact and peculiar systems in the distant universe to the formation of the Hubble sequence we find today. This review further addresses how structural methods measure accurately the merger history out to z{\~{}}3. The properties and evolution of bulges, disks, bars, and at z{\textgreater}1 large star forming clumps are also described, along with how morphological galaxy quenching occurs. Furthermore, the role of environment in producing structure in galaxies over cosmic time is treated. Alongside the evolution of general structure, I also delineate how galaxy sizes change with time, with measured sizes up to a factor of 2-5 smaller at high redshift at a given stellar mass. This review concludes with a discussion of how galaxy structure reveals the formation mechanisms behind galaxies, providing a new and unique way to test theories of galaxy formation.},

abstract = {We present the second major release of data from the Sydney - Australian Astronomical Observatory Multi-Object Integral Field Spectrograph (SAMI) Galaxy Survey. Data Release Two includes data for 1559 galaxies, about 50 per cent of the full survey. Galaxies included have a redshift range 0.004 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.113 and a large stellar mass range 7.5 {\textless} log (M*/M⊙) {\textless} 11.6. The core data for each galaxy consist of two primary spectral cubes covering the blue and red optical wavelength ranges. For each primary cube, we also provide three spatially binned spectral cubes and a set of standardized aperture spectra. For each core data product, we provide a set of value-added data products. This includes all emission line value-added products from Data Release One, expanded to the larger sample. In addition, we include stellar kinematic and stellar population value-added products derived from absorption line measurements. The data are provided online through Australian Astronomical Optics' Data Central. We illustrate the potential of this release by presenting the distribution of {\~{}}350 000 stellar velocity dispersion measurements from individual spaxels as a function of R/Re, divided in four galaxy mass bins. In the highest stellar mass bin [log (M*/M⊙) {\textgreater} 11], the velocity dispersion strongly increases towards the centre, whereas below log (M*/M⊙) {\textless} 10 we find no evidence for a clear increase in the central velocity dispersion. This suggests a transition mass around log (M*/M⊙) {\~{}} 10 for galaxies with or without a dispersion-dominated bulge.},

abstract = {I start by providing an updated summary of the penalized pixel-fitting (PPXF) method that is used to extract the stellar and gas kinematics, as well as the stellar population of galaxies, via full spectrum fitting. I then focus on the problem of extracting the kinematics when the velocity dispersion s is smaller than the velocity sampling $\Delta$V that is generally, by design, close to the instrumental dispersion $\sigma$inst. The standard approach consists of convolving templates with a discretized kernel, while fitting for its parameters. This is obviously very inaccurate when $\sigma$≲ $\Delta$V /2, due to undersampling. Oversampling can prevent this, but it has drawbacks. Here I present a more accurate and efficient alternative. It avoids the evaluation of the undersampled kernel and instead directly computes its well-sampled analytic Fourier transform, for use with the convolution theorem. A simple analytic transform exists when the kernel is described by the popular Gauss-Hermite parametrization (which includes the Gaussian as special case) for the line-of-sight velocity distribution. I describe how this idea was implemented in a significant upgrade to the publicly available PPXF software. The key advantage of the new approach is that it provides accurate velocities regardless of $\sigma$. This is important e.g. for spectroscopic surveys targeting galaxies with $\sigma$ ≪$\sigma$inst, for galaxy redshift determinations or for measuring line-of-sight velocities of individual stars. The proposed method could also be used to fix Gaussian convolution algorithms used in today's popular software packages.},

abstract = {Low-mass "dwarf" galaxies represent the most significant challenges to the cold dark matter (CDM) model of cosmological structure formation. Because these faint galaxies are (best) observed within the Local Group (LG) of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31), understanding their formation in such an environment is critical. We present first results from the Latte Project: the Milky Way on FIRE (Feedback in Realistic Environments). This simulation models the formation of a MW-mass galaxy to z = 0 within LCDM cosmology, including dark matter, gas, and stars at unprecedented resolution: baryon particle mass of 7070 Msun with gas kernel/softening that adapts down to 1 pc (with a median of 25 - 60 pc at z = 0). Latte was simulated using the GIZMO code with a mesh-free method for accurate hydrodynamics and the FIRE-2 model for star formation and explicit feedback within a multi-phase interstellar medium. For the first time, Latte self-consistently resolves the spatial scales corresponding to half-light radii of dwarf galaxies that form around a MW-mass host down to Mstar {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}5 Msun. Latte's population of dwarf galaxies agrees with the LG across a broad range of properties: (1) distributions of stellar masses and stellar velocity dispersions (dynamical masses), including their joint relation; (2) the mass-metallicity relation; and (3) a diverse range of star-formation histories, including their mass dependence. Thus, Latte produces a realistic population of dwarf galaxies at Mstar {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}5 Msun that does not suffer from the "missing satellites" or "too big to fail" problems of small-scale structure formation. We conclude that baryonic physics can reconcile observed dwarf galaxies with standard LCDM cosmology.},

abstract = {We study the volume-limited and nearly mass-selected (stellar mass Mstars ≳ 6 × 109 M⊙) ATLAS3D sample of 260 early-type galaxies (ETGs, ellipticals Es and lenticulars S0s). We construct detailed axisymmetric dynamical models (Jeans Anisotropic MGE), which allow for orbital anisotropy, include a dark matter halo and reproduce in detail both the galaxy images and the high-quality integral-field stellar kinematics out to about 1Re, the projected half-light radius. We derive accurate total mass-to-light ratios (M/L)e and dark matter fractions fDM, within a sphere of radius r = Re centred on the galaxies.We alsomeasure the stellar (M/L)stars and derive a median dark matter fraction fDM = 13 per cent in our sample. We infer masses MJAM = L × (M/L)e ≈ 2 ×M1/2, where M1/2 is the total mass within a sphere enclosing half of the galaxy light. We find that the thin two-dimensional subset spanned by galaxies in the (MJAM, $\sigma$e,Rmaje ) coordinates system, which we call the Mass Plane (MP) has an observed rms scatter of 19 per cent, which implies an intrinsic one of 11 per cent. Here, Rmaje is the major axis of an isophote enclosing half of the observed galaxy light, while $\sigma$e is measuredwithin that isophote. The MP satisfies the scalar virial relation MJAM ∝ $\sigma$2e Rmaje within our tight errors. This show that the larger scatter in the Fundamental Plane (FP) (L, $\sigma$e, Re) is due to stellar population effects [including trends in the stellar initial mass function (IMF)]. It confirms that the FP deviation from the virial exponents is due to a genuine (M/L)e variation. However, the details of how both Re and $\sigma$e are determined are critical in defining the precise deviation from the virial exponents. The main uncertainty in masses or M/L estimates using the scalar virial relation is in the measurement of Re. This problem is already relevant for nearby galaxies and may cause significant biases in virial mass and size determinations at high redshift. Dynamical models can eliminate these problems.We revisit the (M/L)e-$\sigma$e relation, which describes most of the deviations between the MP and the FP. The best-fitting relation is (M/L)e ∝ $\sigma$0.72e (r band). It provides an upper limit to any systematic increase of the IMF mass normalization with $\sigma$e. The correlation is more shallow and has smaller scatter for slow rotating systems or for galaxies in Virgo. For the latter, when using the best distance estimates, we observe a scatter in (M/L)e of 11 per cent, and infer an intrinsic one of 8 per cent. We perform an accurate empirical study of the link between se and the galaxies circular velocity Vcirc within 1Re (where stars dominate) and find the relation max (Vcirc) ≈ 1.76 × $\sigma$e, which has an observed scatter of 7 per cent. The accurate parameters described in this paper are used in the companion Paper XX (Cappellari et al.) of this series to explore the variation of global galaxy properties, including the IMF, on the projections of the MP. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {We find that the minor axes of the ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in Abell 2634 tend to be aligned with the major axis of the central dominant galaxy, at a 95 per cent confidence level. This alignment is produced by the bright UDGs with the absolute magnitudes Mr 15.3 mag, and outer-region UDGs with R 0.5R200. The alignment signal implies that these bright, outer-region UDGs are very likely to acquire their angular momenta from the vortices around the large-scale filament before they were accreted into A2634, and form their extended stellar bodies outside of the cluster; in this scenario, the orientations of their primordial angular momenta, which are roughly shown by their minor axes on the images, should tend to be parallel to the elongation of the large-scale filament. When these UDGs fell into the unrelaxed cluster A2634 along the filament, they could still preserve their primordial alignment signal before violent relaxation and encounters. These bright, outer-region UDGs in A2634 are very unlikely to be the descendants of the high-surface-brightness dwarf progenitors under tidal interactions with the central dominant galaxy in the cluster environment. Our results indicate that the primordial alignment could be a useful probe of the origin of UDGs in large-scale structures.},

abstract = {Ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) and dwarf galaxy nuclei have many common properties. such as internal velocity dispersions and colour-magnitude trends, suggesting tidally stripped dwarf galaxies as a possible UCD origin. However. UCDs typically have sizes more than twice as large as nuclei at the same luminosity. We use a graphics processing unit (GPU)-enabled version of the particle-mesh code SUPERBOX to study the possibility of turning nucleated dwarf galaxies into UCDs by tidally stripping them in a Virgo-like galaxy cluster. We find that motion in spherical potentials, where close passages happen many times, leads to the formation of compact (rh, ≲ 20 pc) star clusters/UCDs. In contrast, orbital motion where close passages happen only once or twice leads to the formation of extended objects which are large enough to account for the full range of observed UCD sizes. For such motion, we find that dwarf galaxies need close pericentre passages with distances less than 10kpc to undergo strong enough stripping so that UCD formation is possible. As tidal stripping produces objects with similar properties to UCDs. and our estimates suggest dwarf galaxies have been destroyed in sufficient numbers to explain the observed number of UCDs in M87. we consider tidal stripping to be a likely origin of UCDs. However, comparison with cosmological simulations is needed to determine if the number and spatial distribution of UCDs formed by tidal stripping matches the observations of UCDs in galaxy clusters. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {In the Local Group, quenched gas-poor dwarfs galaxies are most often found close to the Milky Way and Andromeda, while star forming gas-rich ones are located at greater distances. This so-called morphology-density relation is often interpreted as the consequence of the ram pressure stripping of the satellites during their interaction with the Milky Way hot halo gas. While this process has been often investigated, self-consistent high resolution simulations were still missing. In this study, we have analysed the impact of both the ram pressure and tidal forces induced by a host galaxy on dwarf models as realistic as possible emerging from cosmological simulations. These models were re-simulated using both a wind tunnel and a moving box technique. The secular mass growth of the central host galaxy, as well as the gas density and temperature profiles of its hot halo have been taken into account. We show that while ram pressure is very efficient at stripping the hot and diffuse gas of the dwarf galaxies, it can remove their cold gas ( T {\textless} 10 3 K) only in very specific conditions. Depending on the infall time of the satellites relatively to the build-up stage of the massive host, star formation can thus be prolonged instead of being quenched. This is the direct consequence of the clumpy nature of the cold gas and the thermal pressure the hot gas exerts onto it. We discuss the possibility that the variety in satellite populations among Milky Way-like galaxies reflects their accretion histories.},

abstract = {Using idealized one-dimensional Eulerian hydrodynamic simulations, we contrast the behaviour of isolated supernovae with the superbubbles driven by multiple, collocated supernovae. Continuous energy injection via successive supernovae exploding within the hot/dilute bubble maintains a strong termination shock. This strong shock keeps the superbubble overpressured and drives the outer shock well after it becomes radiative. Isolated supernovae, in contrast, with no further energy injection, become radiative quite early (≲0.1Myr, tens of pc), and stall at scales ≲100 pc. We show that isolated supernovae lose almost all of their mechanical energy by 1 Myr, but superbubbles can retain up to ̃40 per cent of the input energy in the form of mechanical energy over the lifetime of the star cluster (a few tens of Myr). These conclusions hold even in the presence of realistic magnetic fields and thermal conduction.We also compare various methods for implementing supernova feedback in numerical simulations. For various feedback prescriptions, we derive the spatial scale below which the energy needs to be deposited in order for it to couple to the interstellar medium. We show that a steady thermal wind within the superbubble appears only for a large number (≳104) of supernovae. For smaller clusters, we expect multiple internal shocks instead of a smooth, dense thermalized wind. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

These clustering properties vary with galaxy baryon mass and, more strongly, with stellar population age, in good qualitative agreement with the observed dependence of galaxy clustering and galaxy-mass correlations on galaxy type. The predicted ratio dM(260)/M{\_}b is lower than the SDSS estimates for galaxies with M{\_}b{\textgreater}{\~{}}2e11 Msun, but numerical resolution effects account for most of this discrepancy, leaving little room for feedback or other astrophysical processes to reduce the stellar masses of luminous galaxies, at least given our adopted cosmological parameters. Our results show that the LCDM model and the galaxy formation physics incorporated in the SPH simulation give a good account of observed galaxy clustering, but anticipated improvements in clustering and weak lensing measurements will soon test this picture in much more detail.},

abstract = {Ultra compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) have similar properties as massive globular clusters or the nuclei of nucleated galaxies. Recent observations suggesting a high dark matter content and a steep spatial distribution within groups and clusters provide new clues as to their origins.We perform high-resolution N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations designed to elucidate two possible formation mechanisms for these systems: the merging of globular clusters in the centre of a dark matter halo, or the massively stripped remnant of a nucleated galaxy. Both models produce density profiles as well as the half light radii that can fit the observational constraints. However, we show that the first scenario results to UCDs that are underluminous and contain no dark matter. This is because the sinking process ejects most of the dark matter particles from the halo centre. Stripped nuclei give a more promising explanation, especially if the nuclei form via the sinking of gas, funneled down inner galactic bars, since this process enhances the central dark matter content. Even when the entire disk is tidally stripped away, the nucleus stays intact and can remain dark matter dominated even after severe stripping. Total galaxy disruption beyond the nuclei only occurs on certain orbits and depends on the amount of dissipation during nuclei formation. By comparing the total disruption of CDM subhaloes in a cluster potential we demonstrate that this model also leads to the observed spatial distribution of UCDs which can be tested in more detail with larger data sets. ??

abstract = {The neutral atomic hydrogen (H I) content of spiral galaxies has been observed to vary with environment,with moreHI-deficient spirals residing in high-density environments. This can be attributed to environmental effects such as ram pressure stripping and tidal interactions, which remove HI from the discs of galaxies. However, some spirals in low-density environments have also been observed to have relatively low HI mass fractions. The low densities of the intergalactic medium and lack of nearby galaxies in such environments make ram pressure stripping and tidal interactions unlikely candidates of gas removal. What then could be making these spirals HI deficient? Obreschkow et al. introduced a parameter-free model for the neutral atomic gas fraction (fatm), in a symmetric equilibrium disc as a function of the global atomic stability parameter (q), which depends on specific angular momentum. In order to examine if this model accounts for HI-deficient galaxies in low-density environments, we have used the MH I-MR scaling relation to select six HI-deficient spiral galaxies and observed them with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. By measuring their fatm and q values we find that the galaxies owe their observed HI deficiencies to low specific angular momenta. Additionally, we also find that the central HI hole sizes of our sample galaxies are related to their q values, following the prediction of Obreschkow et al. This result brings to light the importance of angular momentum in understanding the physics of the interstellar medium in the discs of galaxies and consequently their evolution.},
